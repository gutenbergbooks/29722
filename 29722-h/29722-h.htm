With eloquent tongue,&mdash;that Toil from wrong be freed!</td></tr></table>

<h2>ADVERTISEMENT.</h2>

<p>Several pieces in the following Rhyme were written many years ago, and
will be recognised by my early friends. They were the fruit of
impressions derived from the local associations of boyhood, (of which,
the reader, if inclined, may learn more in the notes,) and of an
admiration created by the exquisite beauty and simplicity of Coleridge's
'Christabel,'&mdash;which I had by heart, and used to repeat to Thomas
Miller, my playmate and companion from infancy, during many a delightful
'Day in the Woods,' and pleasing ramble on the hills and in the woods
above Gainsborough, and along the banks of Trent.</p>

<p>I offer but one apology for the production of a metrical essay, composed
chiefly of imperfect and immature pieces:&mdash;the ambition to contribute
towards the fund of Christmas entertainment, in which agreeable labour I
see many popular names engaged,&mdash;and among them, one, the most
deservedly popular in the literature of the day. The favour with which
an influential portion of the press has received my 'Prison Rhyme'
emboldens me to take this step; and if the flagellation of criticism be
not too keenly dealt upon me for the imperfections in the few pages that
follow, I will be content, in this instance, to expect no praise.</p>

<h3>THE</h3>
<h2>BARON'S YULE FEAST.</h2>

<h3>A</h3>
<h2>Christmas Rhyme.</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">Canto</span> I.</h2>

<div class="poem">
Right beautiful is Torksey's hall,<small><a name="f1.1" id="f1.1" href="#f1">[1]</a></small><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Adown by meadowed Trent;</span><br />
Right beautiful that mouldering wall,<br />
And remnant of a turret tall,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Shorn of its battlement.</span><br />
<br />
For, while the children of the Spring<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Blush into life, and die;</span><br />
And Summer's joy-birds take light wing<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When Autumn mists are nigh;</span><br />
And soon the year&mdash;a winterling&mdash;<br />
With its fall'n leaves doth lie;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 3em;">That ruin gray&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Mirror'd, alway,</span><br />
Deep in the silver stream,<br />
Doth summon weird-wrought visions vast,<br />
That show the actors of the past<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Pictured, as in a dream.</span><br />
<br />
Meseemeth, now, before mine eyes,<br />
The pomp-clad phantoms dimly rise,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Till the full pageant bright&mdash;</span><br />
A throng of warrior-barons bold,<br />
Glittering in burnished steel and gold,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Bursts on my glowing sight.</span><br />
<br />
And, mingles with the martial train,<br />
Full many a fair-tressed beauty vain,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On palfrey and jennet&mdash;</span><br />
That proudly toss the tasselled rein,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And daintily curvet;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">And war-steeds prance,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">And rich plumes glance</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On helm and burgonet;</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 3em;">And lances crash,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">And falchions flash</span><br />
Of knights in tourney met.<br />
<br />
Fast fades the joust!&mdash;and fierce forms frown<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That man the leaguered tower,&mdash;</span><br />
Nor quail to scan the kingly crown<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That leads the leaguering power.</span><br />
<br />
Trumpet and "rescue" ring!&mdash;and, soon,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He who began the strife</span><br />
Is fain to crave one paltry boon:&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The thrall-king begs his life!</span><br />
<br />
Our fathers and their throbbing toil<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Are hushed in pulseless death;</span><br />
Hushed is the dire and deadly broil&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The tempest of their wrath;&mdash;</span><br />
Yet, of their deeds not all for spoil<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Is thine, O sateless Grave!</span><br />
Songs of their brother-hours shall foil<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thy triumph o'er the brave!</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span><br />
Their bravery take, and darkly hide<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Deep in thy inmost hold!</span><br />
Take all their mail&euml;d pomp and pride<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To deck thy mansions cold!</span><br />
Plunderer! thou hast but purified<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Their memories from alloy:</span><br />
Faults of the dead we scorn to chide&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Their virtues sing with joy.</span><br />
<br />
Lord of our fathers' ashes! list<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A carol of their mirth;</span><br />
Nor shake thy nieve, chill moralist!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To check their sons' joy-birth:&mdash;</span><br />
<br />
It is the season when our sires<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Kept jocund holiday;</span><br />
And, now, around our charier fires,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Old Yule shall have a lay:&mdash;</span><br />
A prison-bard is once more free;<br />
And, ere he yields his voice to thee,<br />
His song a merry-song shall be!<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span><br />
Sir Wilfrid de Thorold<small><a name="f2.1" id="f2.1" href="#f2">[2]</a></small> freely holds<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">What his stout sires held before&mdash;</span><br />
Broad lands for plough, and fruitful folds,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Though by gold he sets no store;</span><br />
And he saith, from fen and woodland wolds,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From marish, heath, and moor,&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">To feast in his hall,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Both free and thrall,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Shall come as they came of yore.</span><br />
<br />
"Let the merry bells ring out!" saith he<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To my lady of the Fosse;<small><a name="f3.1" id="f3.1" href="#f3">[3]</a></small></span><br />
"We will keep the birth-eve joyfully<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of our Lord who bore the cross!"</span><br />
<br />
"Let the merry bells ring loud!" he saith<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To saint Leonard's shaven prior;<small><a name="f4.1" id="f4.1" href="#f4">[4]</a></small></span><br />
"Bid thy losel monks that patter of faith<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Shew works, and never tire."</span><br />
Saith the lord of saint Leonard's: "The brotherhood<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Will ring and never tire</span><br />
For a beck or a nod of the Baron good;"&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Saith Sir Wilfrid: "They will&mdash;for hire!"</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span><br />
Then, turning to his daughter fair,<br />
Who leaned on her father's carven chair,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">He said,&mdash;and smiled</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">On his peerless child,&mdash;</span><br />
His jewel whose price no clerk could tell,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Though the clerk had told</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Sea sands for gold;&mdash;</span><br />
For her dear mother's sake he loved her well,&mdash;<br />
But more for the balm her tenderness<br />
Had poured on his widowed heart's distress;&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">More, still more, for her own heart's grace</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That so lovelily shone in her lovely face,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And drew all eyes its love to trace&mdash;</span><br />
Left all tongues languageless!&mdash;<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">He said,&mdash;and smiled</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">On his peerless child,</span><br />
"Sweet bird! bid Hugh our seneschal<br />
Send to saint Leonard's, ere even-fall,<br />
A fat fed beeve, and a two-shear sheep,<br />
With a firkin of ale that a monk in his sleep<br />
May hear to hum, when it feels the broach,<br />
And wake up and swig, without reproach!&mdash;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>And the nuns of the Fosse&mdash;for wassail-bread&mdash;<br />
Let them have wheat, both white and red;<br />
And a runlet of mead, with a jug of the wine<br />
Which the merchant-man vowed he brought from the Rhine;<br />
And bid Hugh say that their bells must ring<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A peal loud and long,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">While we chaunt heart-song,</span><br />
For the birth of our heavenly king!"<br />
<br />
Now merrily ring the lady-bells<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of the nunnery by the Fosse:&mdash;</span><br />
Say the hinds, "Their silver music swells<br />
Like the blessed angels' syllables,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">At his birth who bore the cross!"</span><br />
<br />
And solemnly swells saint Leonard's chime<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the great bell loud and deep:&mdash;</span><br />
Say the gossips, "Let's talk of the holy time<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When the shepherds watched their sheep;</span><br />
And the Babe was born for all souls' crime<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the weakness of flesh to weep."&mdash;</span><br />
But, anon, shrills the pipe of the merry mime,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And their simple hearts upleap.</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span><br />
"God save your souls, good Christian folk!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">God save your souls from sin!&mdash;</span><br />
Blythe Yule is come&mdash;let us blythely joke!"&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Cry the mummers, ere they begin.</span><br />
<br />
Then, plough-boy Jack, in kirtle gay,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Though shod with clouted shoon,&mdash;</span><br />
Stands forth the wilful maid to play<br />
Who ever saith to her lover "Nay"&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When he sues for a lover's boon.</span><br />
<br />
While Hob the smith with sturdy arm<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Circleth the feign&euml;d maid;</span><br />
And, spite of Jack's assumed alarm,<br />
Busseth his lips, like a lover warm,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And will not "Nay" be said.</span><br />
<br />
Then loffe the gossips, as if wit<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Were mingled with the joke:&mdash;</span><br />
Gentles,&mdash;they were with folly smit,&mdash;<br />
Natheless, their memories acquit<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of crime&mdash;these simple folk!</span><br />
<br />
No harmful thoughts their revels blight,&mdash;<br />
Devoid of bitter hate and spite,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">They hold their merriment;&mdash;</span><br />
And, till the chimes tell noon at night,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Their joy shall be unspent!</span><br />
<br />
"Come haste ye to bold Thorold's hall,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And crowd his kitchen wide;</span><br />
For there, he saith, both free and thrall<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Shall sport this good Yule-tide!</span><br />
<br />
"Come hasten, gossips!" the mummers cry,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Throughout old Torksey town;</span><br />
"We'll hasten!" they answer, joyfully,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The gossip and the clown.</span><br />
<br />
Heigho! whence cometh that cheery shout?<br />
'Tis the Yule-log troop,&mdash;a merry rout!<br />
The gray old ash that so bravely stood,<br />
The pride of the Past, in Thorney wood,<small><a name="f5.1" id="f5.1" href="#f5">[5]</a></small><br />
They have levelled for honour of welcome Yule;<br />
And kirtled Jack is placed astride:<br />
On the log to the grunsel<small><a name="f6.1" id="f6.1" href="#f6">[6]</a></small> he shall ride!<br />
<br />
"Losels, yoke all! yoke to, and pull!"<br />
Cries Dick the wright, on long-eared steed;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 3em;">"He shall have thwack</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">On lazy back,</span><br />
That yoketh him not, in time of need!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">A long wain-whip</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Dick doth equip,</span><br />
And with beans in the bladder at end of thong,<br />
It seemeth to threaten strokes sturdy and strong;&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Yet clown and maid</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Give eager aid,&mdash;</span><br />
And all, as they rattle the huge block along,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Seem to court the joke</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Of Dick's wain-whip stroke,&mdash;</span><br />
Be it ever so smart, none thinks he hath wrong;&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Till with mirthsome glee,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">The old ash tree</span><br />
Hath come to the threshold of Torksey hall,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Where its brave old heart</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">A glow shall impart</span><br />
To the heart of each guest at the festival.<br />
<br />
And through the porch, a jocund crowd,<br />
They rush, with heart-born laughter loud;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>And still the merry mimesters call,<br />
With jest and gibe, "Laugh, losels all!"<br />
<br />
Then in the laden sewers troop,<br />
With plattered beef and foaming stoup:&mdash;<br />
"Make merry, neighbours!" cries good Hugh,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The white-haired seneschal:</span><br />
"Ye trow, bold Thorold welcomes you&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Make merry, my masters, all!"</span><br />
<br />
They pile the Yule-log on the hearth,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Soak toasted crabs in ale;</span><br />
And while they sip, their homely mirth<br />
Is joyous as if all the earth<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For man were void of bale!</span><br />
<br />
And why should fears for future years<br />
Mix jolly ale with thoughts of tears<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When in the horn 'tis poured?</span><br />
And why should ghost of sorrow fright<br />
The bold heart of an English wight<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When beef is on the board?</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span><br />
De Thorold's guests are wiser than<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The men of mopish lore;</span><br />
For round they push the smiling can,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And slice the plattered store.</span><br />
<br />
And round they thrust the ponderous cheese,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the loaves of wheat and rye:</span><br />
None stinteth him for lack of ease&mdash;<br />
For each a stintless welcome sees,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the Baron's blythesome eye.</span><br />
<br />
The Baron joineth the joyous feast&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But not in pomp or pride;</span><br />
He smileth on the humblest guest<br />
So gladsomely&mdash;all feel that rest<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of heart which doth abide</span><br />
Where deeds of generousness attest<br />
The welcome by the tongue professed,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Is not within belied.</span><br />
<br />
And the Baron's beauteous child is there,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In her maiden peerlessness,&mdash;</span><br />
Her eyes diffusing heart-light rare,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>And smiles so sweetly debonair,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That all her presence bless.&mdash;</span><br />
<br />
But wherefore paleth, soon, her cheek?<br />
And why, with trembling, doth she seek<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To shun her father's gaze?</span><br />
And who is he for whom the crowd<br />
Make ready room, and "Welcome" loud<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With gleeful voices raise?</span><br />
<br />
"Right welcome!" though the revellers shout,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They hail the minstrel "Stranger!"</span><br />
And in the Baron's eye dwells doubt,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And his daughter's look thrills "danger!"</span><br />
<br />
Though he seemeth meek the youth is bold,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And his speech is firm and free;</span><br />
He saith he will carol a legend old,<br />
Of a Norman lord of Torksey told:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He learnt it o'er the sea;</span><br />
And he will not sing for the Baron's gold,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But for love of minstrelsy.</span><br />
<br />
"Come, tune thy harp!" the Baron saith,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"And tell thy minstrel tale:</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>It is too late to harbour wrath<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For the thieves in helm and mail:</span><br />
<br />
"Our fathers' home again is ours!&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Though Thorold is Saxon still,</span><br />
To a song of thy foreign troubadours<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He can list with right good will!"</span><br />
<br />
A shout of glee rings to the roof,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the revellers form a ring;</span><br />
Then silent wait to mark what proof<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of skill with voice and string</span><br />
The youthful stranger will afford.<br />
<br />
Full soon he tunes each quivering chord,<br />
And, with preamble wildly sweet<br />
He doth the wondering listeners greet;&mdash;<br />
Then strikes into a changeful chaunt<br />
That fits his fanciful romaunt.</div>

<h4>THE STRANGER MINSTREL'S TALE.</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>FYTTE THE FYRSTE.</h4>

<div class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'Tis midnight, and the broad full moon</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Pours on the earth her silver noon;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Sheeted in white, like spectres of fear,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Their ghostly forms the towers uprear;</span><br />
And their long dark shadows behind them are cast,<br />
Like the frown of the cloud when the lightning hath past.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The warder sleeps on the battlement,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And there is not a breeze to curl the Trent;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The leaf is at rest, and the owl is mute&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But list! awaked is the woodland lute:</span><br />
The nightingale warbles her omen sweet<br />
On the hour when the ladye her lover shall meet.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She waves her hand from the loophole high,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And watcheth, with many a struggling sigh,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And hearkeneth in doubt, and paleth with fear,&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Yet tremblingly trusts her true knight is near;&mdash;</span><br />
And there skims o'er the river&mdash;or doth her heart doat?&mdash;<br />
As with wing of the night-hawk&mdash;her lover's brave boat.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His noble form hath attained the strand,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And she waves again her small white hand;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And breathing to heaven, in haste, a prayer,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Softly glides down the lonely stair;</span><br />
And there stands by the portal, all watchful and still,<br />
Her own faithful damsel awaiting her will.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The midnight lamp gleams dull and pale,&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The maidens twain are weak and frail,&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But Love doth aid his votaries true,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">While they the massive bolts undo,&mdash;</span><br />
And a moment hath flown, and the warrior knight<br />
Embraceth his love in the meek moonlight.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span><br />
The knight his love-prayer, tenderly,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thus breathed in his fair one's ear</span><br />
"Oh! wilt thou not, my Agnes, flee?&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And, quelling thy maiden fear,</span><br />
Away in the fleeting skiff with me,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And, for aye, this lone heart cheer?"</span><br />
<br />
"O let not bold Romara<small><a name="f7.1" id="f7.1" href="#f7">[7]</a></small> seek"&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Soft answered his ladye-love,&mdash;</span><br />
"A father's doating heart to break,<br />
For should I disdainful prove<br />
Of his high behests, his darling child<br />
Will thenceforth be counted a thing defiled;<br />
And the kindling eye of my martial sire<br />
Be robbed of its pride, and be quenched its fire:<br />
Nor long would true Romara deem<br />
The heart of his Agnes beat for him,<br />
And for him alone&mdash;if that heart, he knew,<br />
To its holiest law could be thus untrue."<br />
<br />
His plume-crowned helm the warrior bows<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Low o'er her shoulder fair,</span><br />
And bursting sighs the grief disclose<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His lips can not declare;</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>And swiftly glide the tears of love<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Adown the ladye's cheek;&mdash;</span><br />
Their deep commingling sorrows prove<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The love they cannot speak!</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The moon shines on them, as on things</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">She loves to robe with gladness,&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But all her light no radiance brings</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Unto their hearts' dark sadness:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Forlornly, 'neath her cheerless ray,&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Bosom to bosom beating,&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In speechless agony they stay,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">With burning kisses greeting;&mdash;</span><br />
Nor reck they with what speed doth haste<br />
The present hour to join the past.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Ho! lady Agnes, lady dear!"</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Her fearful damsel cries;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"You reckon not, I deeply fear,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">How swift the moontide flies!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The surly warder will awake,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The morning dawn, anon,&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My heart beginneth sore to quake,&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">I fear we are undone!"</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span><br />
But Love is mightier than Fear:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The ladye hasteth not:</span><br />
The magnet of her heart is near,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And peril is forgot!</span><br />
<br />
She clingeth to her knight's brave breast<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Like a lorn turtle-dove,</span><br />
And 'mid the peril feeleth rest,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The full, rapt rest of Love!</span><br />
<br />
"I charge thee, hie thee hence, sir knight!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The damsel shrilly cries;</span><br />
"If this should meet her father's sight,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">By Heaven! my lady dies."</span><br />
<br />
The warrior rouseth all his pride,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And looseth his love's caress,&mdash;</span><br />
Yet slowness of heart doth his strength betide<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As he looks on her loveliness:&mdash;</span><br />
But again the damsel their love-dream breaks,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And, self-reproachingly,</span><br />
The knight his resolve of its fetters shakes,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And his spirit now standeth free.</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then, came the last, absorbing kiss,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">True Love can ne'er forego,&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That dreamy plenitude of bliss</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Or antepast of woe,&mdash;</span><br />
That seeming child of Heaven, which at its birth<br />
Briefly expires, and proves itself of earth.<br />
<br />
The ladye hieth to her couch;&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And when the morn appears,</span><br />
The changes of her cheek avouch,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Full virginly her fears;&mdash;</span><br />
But her doating father can nought discern<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the hues of the rose and the lily that chase</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Each other across her lovely face,&mdash;</span><br />
Save a sweetness that softens his visage stern.</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>FYTTE THE SECONDE.</h4>

<div class="poem">
Romara's skiff is on the Trent,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the stream is in its strength,&mdash;</span><br />
For a surge, from its ocean-fountain sent,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Pervades its giant length:<small><a name="f8.1" id="f8.1" href="#f8">[8]</a></small></span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>Roars the hoarse heygre<small><a name="f9.1" id="f9.1" href="#f9">[9]</a></small> in its course,<br />
Lashing the banks with its wrathful force;<br />
And dolefully echoes the wild-fowl's scream,<br />
As the sallows are swept by the whelming stream;<br />
And her callow young are hurled for a meal,<br />
To the gorge of the barbel, the pike, and the eel:<br />
The porpoise<small><a name="f10.1" id="f10.1" href="#f10">[10]</a></small> heaves 'mid the rolling tide,<br />
And, snorting in mirth, doth merrily ride,&mdash;<br />
For he hath forsaken his bed in the sea,<br />
To sup on the salmon, right daintily!<br />
<br />
In Romara's breast a tempest raves:<br />
He heeds not the rage of the furrowy waves:<br />
Supremely his hopes and fears are set<br />
On the image of Agnes Plantagenet:<small><a name="f11.1" id="f11.1" href="#f11">[11]</a></small><br />
And though from his vision fade Gainsburgh's towers,<br />
And the moon is beclouded, and darkness lours,<br />
Yet the eye of his passion oft pierceth the gloom,<br />
And beholds his Beloved in her virgin bloom&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Kneeling before the holy Rood,&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">All clasped her hands,&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Beseeching the saints and angels good</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 2em;">That their watchful bands</span><br />
Her knight may preserve from a watery tomb!<br />
<br />
What deathful scream rends Romara's heart?&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Is it the bittern that, flapping the air,</span><br />
Doth shriek in madness, and downward dart,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As if from the bosom of Death she would tear</span><br />
Her perished brood,&mdash;or a shroud would have<br />
By their side, in the depths of their river-grave?<br />
<br />
Hark! hark! again!&mdash;'tis a human cry,<br />
Like the shriek of a man about to die!<br />
And its desolateness doth fearfully pierce<br />
The billowy boom of the torrent fierce;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And, swift as a thought</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Glides the warrior's boat</span><br />
Through the foaming surge to the river's bank,<br />
Where, lo!&mdash;by a branch of the osiers dank,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Clingeth one in agony</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Uttering that doleful cry!</span><br />
<br />
His silvery head of age upborne<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Appeared above the wave;</span><br />
So nearly was his strength outworn,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That all too late to save</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>Had been the knight, if another billow<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Its force on his fainting frame, had bent,&mdash;</span><br />
Nay, his feeble grasp by the drooping willow<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The beat of a pulse might have fatally spent.</span><br />
<br />
With eager pounce did Romara take<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From the yawning wave its prey,&mdash;</span><br />
But nought to his deliverer spake<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The man with the head of gray:</span><br />
And the warrior stripped, with needful haste,<br />
The helpless one of his drench&euml;d vest,<br />
And wrapt his own warm mantle round<br />
The chill one in his deathly swound.<br />
<br />
The sea-born strength of the stream is spent,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And Romara's boat outstrips its speed,&mdash;</span><br />
For his stalwart arm to the oar is bent,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And swiftly the ebbing waves recede.</span><br />
<br />
Divinely streaketh the morning-star<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With a wavy light the rippling waters;</span><br />
And the moon looks on from the west, afar,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And palely smiles, with her waning daughters,</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>The thin-strown stars, which their vigil keep<br />
Till the orient sun shall awake from sleep.<br />
<br />
The sun hath awoke; and in garments of gold<br />
The turrets of Torksey are livingly rolled;<br />
Afar, on Trent's margin, the flowery lea<br />
Exhales her dewy fragrancy;<br />
And gaily carols the matin lark,<br />
As the warrior hastes to moor his bark.<br />
<br />
Two menials hastened to the beach,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For signal none need they;</span><br />
On the towers they kept a heedful watch<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As the skiff glode on its way:</span><br />
<br />
With silent step and breathless care<br />
The rescued one they softly bear,<br />
And bring him, at their lord's behest,<br />
To a couch of silken pillowed rest.<br />
<br />
The serfs could scarce avert their eye<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From his manly form and mien,</span><br />
As, with clos&euml;d lids, all reverendly,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He lay in peace, serene.</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span><br />
And Romara thought, as he gazing leant<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">O'er the slumberer's form, that so pure a trace</span><br />
Of the spirit of Heaven with the earthly blent<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Dwelt only there, and in Agnes' face.</span><br />
<br />
The leech comes forth at the hour of noon,<br />
And saith, that the sick from his deathly swoon<br />
Will awake anon; and Romara's eye,<br />
Uplit, betokens his heartfelt joy;<br />
And again o'er the slumberer's couch he bows<br />
Till, slowly, those peaceful lids unclose,&mdash;<br />
When, long, with heavenward-fix&euml;d gaze,<br />
With lowly prayer and grateful praise,<br />
The aged man, from death reprieved,<br />
His bosom of its joy relieved.&mdash;<br />
<br />
Then did Romara thus address<br />
His gray guest, in his reverendness:<br />
<br />
"Now, man of prayer come tell to me<br />
Some spell of thy holy mystery!<br />
Some vision hast had of the Virgin bright,&mdash;<br />
Or message, conveyed from the world of light,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>By the angels of love who in purity stand<br />
'Fore the throne of our Lord in the heavenly land?<br />
<br />
"I hope, when I die, to see them there:<br />
For I love the angels so holy and fair:<br />
And often, I trust, my prayer they greet<br />
With smiles, when I kneel and kiss their feet<br />
In the missal, my mother her weeping child gave,<br />
But a day or two ere she was laid in the grave.<br />
<br />
"Sage man of prayer, come tell to me<br />
What holy shapes in sleep they see<br />
Who love the blest saints and serve them well!<br />
I pray thee, sage man, to Romara tell,<br />
For a guerdon, thy dreams,&mdash;sith, to me thou hast said<br />
No thanks that I rescued thy soul from the dead."<br />
<br />
But, when the aged man arose<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And met Romara's wistful eye,&mdash;</span><br />
What accents shall the change disclose<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That marked his visage, fearfully?&mdash;</span><br />
From joy to grief and deepest dole,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From radiant hope to dark presage</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>Of future ills beyond control&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Hath passed, the visage of the sage.</span><br />
<br />
"Son of an honoured line, I grieve,"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Outspake the reverend seer,</span><br />
"That I no guerdon thee can give<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But words of woe and fear!&mdash;</span><br />
Thy sun is setting!&mdash;and thy race,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In thee, their goodly heir,</span><br />
Shall perish, nor a feeble trace<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Their fated name declare!&mdash;</span><br />
Thy love is fatal: fatal, too,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">This act of rescue brave&mdash;</span><br />
For, him who from destruction drew<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My life, no arm can save!"</span><br />
<br />
He said,&mdash;and took his lonely way<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Far from Romara's towers.&mdash;</span><br />
His fateful end from that sad day<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">O'er Torksey's chieftain lowers:&mdash;</span><br />
Yet, vainly, in his heart a shrine<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Hope builds for love,&mdash;with faith;&mdash;</span><br />
Alas! for him with frown malign<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Waiteth the grim king Death!</span></div>

<h3>FYTTE THE THYRDE.</h3>


<div class="poem">
Plantagenet hath dungeons deep<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Beneath his castled halls;&mdash;</span><br />
Plantagenet awakes from sleep<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To count his dungeoned thralls.</span><br />
<br />
Alone, with the torch of blood-red flame,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The man of blood descends;</span><br />
And the fettered captives curse his name,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As through the vaults he wends.&mdash;</span><br />
<br />
His caverns are visited, all, save one,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The deepest, and direst in gloom,&mdash;</span><br />
Where his father, doomed by a demon son,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Abode in a living tomb.&mdash;</span><br />
<br />
"I bring thee bread and water, sire!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Brave usury for thy gold!</span><br />
I fear my filial zeal will tire<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To visit, soon, thy hold!"</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span><br />
Thus spake the fiendish-hearted lord,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And wildly laughed, in scorn:</span><br />
Like thunder round the cell each word<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">By echoing fiends is borne,&mdash;</span><br />
But not a human heart is there<br />
The baron's scorn or hate to fear!<br />
<br />
And the captives tell, as he passeth again,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That tyrant, in his rage,&mdash;</span><br />
How an angel hath led the aged man<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To his heavenly heritage!</span><br />
<br />
The wrathful baron little recked<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That angel was his darling child;</span><br />
Or knew his dark ambition checked<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">By her who oft his rage beguiled,&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">By her on whom he ever smiled:&mdash;</span><br />
This had he known, from that dread hour,<br />
His darling's smile had lost its power,&mdash;<br />
And his own hand, without remorse,<br />
Had laid her at his feet a corse!&mdash;<br />
<br />
Plantagenet's banners in pride are borne<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To the sound of pipe and drum!</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>And his mail&euml;d bands, with the dawn of morn,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To Romara's walls are come.</span><br />
"We come not as foes," the herald saith,&mdash;<br />
"But we bring Plantagenet's shriven faith<br />
That thou, Romara, in thine arms<br />
Shall soon enfold thy true love's charms:<br />
Let no delay thy joy betide!&mdash;<br />
Thy Agnes soon shall be thy bride!"<br />
<br />
The raven croaks as Torksey's lord<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Attends that bannered host;</span><br />
But the lover is deaf to the omen-bird&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The fatal moat is crossed!</span><br />
<br />
"Ride, ride;" saith the baron,&mdash;"thy ladye fain<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the priest&mdash;by the altar wait!"&mdash;</span><br />
And the spearmen seize his bridle-rein,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And hurry him to his fate.</span><br />
<br />
"A marriage by torchlight!" the baron said;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"This stair to the altar leads!</span><br />
We patter our prayers, 'mong the mouldering dead,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And there we tell our beads!"</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span><br />
Along the caverned dungeon's gloom<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The tyrant strides in haste;</span><br />
And, powerless, to his dreadful doom<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The victim followeth fast.</span><br />
The daz&euml;d captives quake and stare<br />
At the sullen torch's blood-red glare,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the lover starts aghast</span><br />
At the deathlike forms they wear!<br />
<br />
Too late, the truth upon him breaks!&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Romara's heart is faint!&mdash;</span><br />
"Behold thy bride!" the baron shrieks&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Wilt hear the wedding chaunt?</span><br />
This chain once bound my father here,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Who would have found his grave&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The cursed dotard!&mdash;'neath the wave,&mdash;</span><br />
Had not thy hateful hand been near.&mdash;<br />
Be this the bride thou now shalt wed!<br />
This dungeon dank thy bridal bed!&mdash;<br />
And when thy youthful blood shall freeze<br />
In death,&mdash;may fiends thy spirit seize!"&mdash;<br />
<br />
Plantagenet hath minions fell<br />
Who do their master's bidding well:&mdash;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>Few days Romara pines in dread:&mdash;<br />
His soul is with the sainted dead!&mdash;<br />

What terrors meet his soul forlorn<br />
And full of stain,&mdash;I may not say:&mdash;<br />
Reveal them shall the Judgment Day!&mdash;<br />
<br />
Her orisons at matin hour,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">At noon, and eve, and midnight toll,</span><br />

<h3>THE</h3>
<h2>BARON'S YULE FEAST.</h2>

<h3>A</h3>
<h2>Christmas Rhyme.</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">Canto</span> II.</h2>

<div class="poem">
Symphonious notes of dulcet plaint<br />
Followed the stranger minstrel's chaunt;<br />
And, when his sounding harp was dumb,<br />
The crowd, with loud applausive hum,<br />
Gave hearty guerdon for his strain;<br />
While some with sighs expressed what pain<br />
Had pierced their simple bosoms thorow<br />
To hear his song of death and sorrow.<br />
<br />
"Come bear the mead-cup to our guest,"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Said Thorold to his daughter;</span><br />
"We thought to hear, at our Yule feast,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A lay of mirth and laughter;</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>But, to thy harp, thou well hast sung<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A song that may impart,</span><br />
For future hours, to old and young,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Deep lessons to the heart.</span><br />
Yet, should not life be all a sigh!<br />
Good Snell, do thou a burthen try<br />
Shall change our sadness into joy:<br />
Such as thou trollest in blythe mood,<br />
On days of sunshine in the wood.<br />
Tell out thy heart withouten fear&mdash;<br />
For none shall stifle free thoughts here!<br />
But, bear the mead-cup, Edith sweet!<br />
We crave our stranger guest will greet<br />
All hearts, again, with minstrelsy,<br />
When Snell hath trolled his mirth-notes free!"<br />
<br />
Fairer than fairest flower that blows,&mdash;<br />
Sweeter than breath of sweetest rose,&mdash;<br />
Still on her cheek, in lustre left,<br />
The tear the minstrel's tale had reft<br />
From its pearl-treasure in the brain&mdash;<br />
The limbec where, by mystic vein,<br />
From the heart's fountains are distilled<br />
Those crystals, when 'tis overfilled,&mdash;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>With downcast eye, and trembling hands,<br />
Edith before the stranger stands&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Stranger to all but her!</span><br />
Though well the baron notes his brow,<br />
While the young minstrel kneeleth low&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Love's grateful worshipper!&mdash;</span><br />
And doth with lips devout impress<br />
The hand of his fair ministress!<br />
<br />
Yet, was the deed so meekly done,&mdash;<br />
His guerdon seemed so fairly won,&mdash;<br />
The tribute he to beauty paid<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So deeply all believed deserved,&mdash;</span><br />
That nought of blame Sir Wilfrid said,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Though much his thoughts from meekness swerved.</span><br />
<br />
Impatience, soon, their faces tell<br />
To hear the song of woodman Snell,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Among the festive crew;</span><br />
And, soon, their old and honest frere,<br />
Elated by the good Yule cheer,<br />
In untaught notes, but full and clear,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thus told his heart-thoughts true:&mdash;</span></div>

<h2>The Woodman's Song.</h2>

<div class="poem">
I would not be a crown&euml;d king,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For all his gaudy gear;</span><br />
I would not be that pampered thing,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His gew-gaw gold to wear:</span><br />
But I would be where I can sing<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Right merrily, all the year;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Where forest treen,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">All gay and green,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Full blythely do me cheer.</span><br />
<br />
I would not be a gentleman,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For all his hawks and hounds,&mdash;</span><br />
For fear the hungry poor should ban<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My halls and wide-parked grounds:</span><br />
But I would be a merry man,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Among the wild wood sounds,&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Where free birds sing,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">And echoes ring</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">While my axe from the oak rebounds.</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span><br />
I would not be a shaven priest,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For all his sloth-won tythe:</span><br />
But while to me this breath is leased,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And these old limbs are lithe,&mdash;</span><br />
Ere Death hath marked me for his feast,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And felled me with his scythe,&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">I'll troll my song,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">The leaves among,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">All in the forest blythe.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</span><br />
<br />
"Well done, well done!" bold Thorold cried,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When the woodman ceased to sing;</span><br />
"By'r Lady! it warms the Saxon tide<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In our veins to hear thee bring</span><br />
These English thoughts so freely out!<br />
Thy health, good Snell!"&mdash;and a merry shout<br />
For honest boldness, truth, and worth,<br />
The baron's grateful guests sent forth.<br />
<br />
Silence like grave-yard air, again,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Pervades the festive space:</span><br />
All list for another minstrel strain;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the youth, with merrier face,</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>But tender notes, thus half-divulged<br />
The passion which his heart indulged:&mdash;</div>

<h3>The Minstrel's Song.</h3>


<div class="poem">
O choose thou the maid with the gentle blue eye,<br />
That speaketh so softly, and looketh so shy;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Who weepeth for pity,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">To hear a love ditty,</span><br />
And marketh the end with a sigh.<br />
<br />
If thou weddest a maid with a wide staring look,<br />
Who babbleth as loud as the rain-swollen brook,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Each day for the morrow</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Will nurture more sorrow,&mdash;</span><br />
Each sun paint thy shadow a-crook.<br />
<br />
The maid that is gentle will make a kind wife;<br />
The magpie that prateth will stir thee to strife:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">'Twere better to tarry,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Unless thou canst marry</span><br />
To sweeten the bitters of life!<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</span></div>

<div class="poem">
What fires the youthful minstrel's lay<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Lit in De Thorold's eyes,</span><br />
It needs not, now, I soothly say:<br />
Sweet Edith had softly stolen away,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And 'mid his own surprise,</span><br />
Blent with the boisterous applause<br />
That, instant, to the rafters rose,<br />
The baron his jealous thought forgot.<br />
Quickly, sithence a jocund note<br />
Was fairly struck in every mind,<br />
And jolly ale its power combined<br />
To fill all hearts with deeper glee,&mdash;<br />
All wished for gleeful minstrelsy;<br />
And every eye was shrewdly bent<br />
On one whose caustic merriment<br />
At many a blythe Yule-tide had bin<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>Compelling cause of mirthful grin<br />
To ancient Torksey's rustic folk.<br />
<br />
Full soon this sturdy summons broke<br />
From sire and son, and maid and mother:&mdash;<br />
"Ho, ho! saint Leonard's fat lay brother!<br />
Why dost thou in the corner peep,<br />
And sipple as if half asleep<br />
Thou wert with this good nappy ale?<br />
Come, rouse thee! for thy sly old tale<br />
Of the Miller of Roche and the hornless devil,<br />
We'll hear, or we leave our Yule-night revel!<br />
Thy folded cloak come cast aside!&mdash;<br />
Beneath it thou dost thy rebeck hide&mdash;<br />
It is thy old trick&mdash;we know it well&mdash;<br />
Pledge all! and thy ditty begin to tell!"<br />
"Pledge all, pledge all!" the baron cried;<br />
"Let mirth be free at good Yule-tide!"<br />
<br />
Then, forth the lay brother his rebeck drew,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And athwart the triple string</span><br />
The bow in gamesome mood he threw,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His joke-song preluding;&mdash;</span><br />
Soon, with sly look, the burly man,<br />
In burly tones his tale began.</div>

<h4>THE LAY BROTHER OF SAINT LEONARD'S TALE.</h4>

<div class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">O the Prior of Roche</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Was without reproach</span><br />
While with saintly monks he chanted;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But when from the mass</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He had turned his face,</span><br />
The prior his saintship scanted.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">O the Miller of Roche,&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I swear and avouch,&mdash;</span><br />
Had a wife of nut-brown beauty;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And to shrive her,&mdash;they say,&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The prior, each day,</span><br />
Came with zeal to his ghostly duty.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But the neighbouring wives,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Who ne'er shrove in their lives,&mdash;</span><br />
Such wickedness Sathanas whispers!&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Said the black-cloaked prior</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">By the miller's log fire,</span><br />
Oft tarried too late for vespers!<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">O the thunder was loud,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the sky wore a shroud,</span><br />
And the lightning blue was gleaming;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the foaming flood,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where the good mill stood,</span><br />
Pell-mell o'er the dam was teeming.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">O the Miller, that night,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Toiled on in a fright,&mdash;</span><br />
Though, through terror, few bushels he grinded!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Yet, although he'd stayed long,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The storm was so strong</span><br />
That full loath to depart was he minded.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Lo! at midnight a jolt,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As loud as the bolt</span><br />
Of the thunder on high that still rumbled,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Assailed the mill-doors,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And burst them, perforce,&mdash;</span><br />
And in a drenched beggar-lad stumbled!<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Saint Luke and saint John</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Save the ground we stand on"&mdash;</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>Cried the Miller,&mdash;"but ye come in a hurry;"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">While the lad, turning pale,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'Gan to weep and to wail,</span><br />
And to patter this pitiful story:<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Goodman Miller, I pray,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Believe what I say,&mdash;</span><br />
For, as surely as thou art a sinner,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Since the break of the morn</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I have wandered forlorn,</span><br />
And have neither had breakfast nor dinner!"<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">O the Miller looked sad,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And cried, "Good lack, my lad!</span><br />
But ye tell me a dolorous ditty!&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And ye seem in sad plight</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To travel to-night:&mdash;</span><br />
The sight o' ye stirs up one's pity!<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Go straight to my cot,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And beg something that's hot,&mdash;</span><br />
For ye look very haggard and hollow:&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The storm's nearly o'er;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I will not grind much more,&mdash;</span><br />
And when I have done, I will follow.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Keep by the brook-side!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The path is not wide&mdash;</span><br />
But ye cannot soon stray, if ye mind it;&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">At the foot of the hill,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Half a mile from the mill,</span><br />
Stands my cottage:&mdash;ye can't fail to find it."<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then out the lad set,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">All dripping with wet,&mdash;</span><br />
But the skies around him seemed brighter;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And he went gaily on,&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For his burthen was gone,&mdash;</span><br />
And his heart in his bosom danced lighter.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Adown by the brook</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His travel he took,</span><br />
And soon raught the Miller's snug dwelling;&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But, what he saw ere</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He was admitted there&mdash;</span><br />
By Saint Bridget!&mdash;I must not be telling!<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thus much I may say&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That the cot was of clay,</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>And the light was through wind-cracks ejected;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And he placed close his eye,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And peeped in, so sly,&mdash;</span><br />
And saw&mdash;what he never expected!<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">O the lad 'gan to fear</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That the Miller would appear,&mdash;</span><br />
And, to him, this strange sight would be vexing;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So he, first, sharply coughed,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And, then, knocked very soft,&mdash;</span><br />
Lest his summons should be too perplexing.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But, I scorn to think harm!&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So pass by all alarm,</span><br />
And trembling, and bustle, and terror,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Occasioned within:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The first stone at sin</span><br />
Let him cast who, himself, hath no error!<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In inquisitive mood,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The eaves-dropper stood,</span><br />
By the wind-cracks still keeping his station;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Till, half-choked with fear,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A voice cried, "Who's there?"&mdash;</span><br />
Cried the beggar, "Mary grant ye salvation!&mdash;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"I'm a poor beggar-lad,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Very hungry and sad,</span><br />
Who have travelled in rain and in thunder;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I am soaked, through and through"&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Cried the voice, "Perhaps 'tis true&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">But who's likely to help thee, I wonder?</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Here's a strange time of night</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To put folk in a fright,</span><br />
By waking them up from their bolsters!&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Honest folk, by Saint Paul!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Abroad never crawl,</span><br />
At the gloom-hour of night&mdash;when the owl stirs!"<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But the Miller now came,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And, hearing his dame</span><br />
So sharply the beggar-lad scolding,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Said, "Open, sweet Joan!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And I'll tell thee, anon,&mdash;</span><br />
When thy brown cheek, once more, I'm beholding,<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Why this poor lad is found</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So late on our ground&mdash;</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>Haste, my pigeon!&mdash;for here there's hard bedding!"&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So the door was unbarred;&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But the wife she frowned hard,</span><br />
As the lad, by the door, thrust his head in.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And she looked very cold</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">While her lord the tale told;</span><br />
And then she made oath, by our Lady,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Such wandering elves</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Might provide for themselves&mdash;</span><br />
For she would get no supper ready!<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">O the Miller waxed wroth,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And vowed, by his troth,&mdash;</span><br />
While the beggar slunk into a corner,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">If his termagant wife</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Did not end her ill strife,</span><br />
He would change words for blows, he'd forewarn her!<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">O the lad he looked sly,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And with mischievous eye,</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>Cried, "Bridle your wrath, Goodman Grinder!&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Don't be in a pet,&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For I don't care a fret!&mdash;</span><br />
Your wife, in a trice, will be kinder!<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"In the stars I have skill,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And their powers, at my will,</span><br />
I can summon, with food to provide us:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Say,&mdash;what d'ye choose?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I pray, don't refuse:&mdash;</span><br />
Neither hunger nor thirst shall betide us!"<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">O the Miller he frowned,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And rolled his eyes round,</span><br />
And seemed not the joke to be liking;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But the lad did not heed:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He was at his strange deed,</span><br />
And the table was chalking and striking!<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With scrawls straight and crookt,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And with signs square and hookt,</span><br />
With the lord of each house, or the lady,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The table he filled,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Like a clerk 'ith' stars skilled,&mdash;</span><br />
And, striking, cried "Presto! be ready!&mdash;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"A jug of spiced wine</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'S in the box,&mdash;I divine!</span><br />
Ask thy wife for the key, and unlock it!&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nay, stop!" the lad said;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"We shall want meat and bread;"</span><br />
And the chalk took again from his pocket.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">O the lad he looked wise,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And, in scholarly guise,</span><br />
Completed his horary question:&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"A brace of roast ducks</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thou wilt find in the box,</span><br />
With the wine&mdash;sure as I am a Christian!&mdash;<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"And a white wheaten loaf;&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Quick! proceed to the proof!"&mdash;</span><br />
Cried the beggar,&mdash;while Grist stood stark staring;&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Though the lad's weasel eyes</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Shone so wondrously wise,</span><br />
That to doubt him seemed sin over-daring!<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">O the Miller's wife, Joan,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Turning pale, 'gan to groan;</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>But the Miller, arousing his spirits,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Said, "Hand me the key,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And our luck we will see&mdash;</span><br />
A faint heart no fortune inherits."<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But,&mdash;Gramercy!&mdash;his looks&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When he opened the box,</span><br />
And at what he saw in it stood wondering!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">How his sturdy arm shook,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">While the wine-jug he took,</span><br />
And feared he would break it with blundering!<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Faith and troth! at the last,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On the table Grist placed</span><br />
The wine and the ducks&mdash;hot and smoking!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Yet he felt grievous shy</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His stomach to try</span><br />
With cates of a wizard's own cooking!<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But, with hunger grown fell,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The lad sped so well,</span><br />
That Grist was soon tempted to join in;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">While Joan sat apart,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And looked sad at heart,</span><br />
And some fearful mishap seemed divining!<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">O the lad chopped away,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And smiling so gay,</span><br />
Told stories to make his host merry:&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">How the Moon kittened stars,&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And how Venus loved Mars,</span><br />
And often went to see him in a wherry!<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">O the Miller he laughed,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the liquor he quaffed;</span><br />
But the beggar new marvels was hatching:&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Quoth he "I'm a clerk,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And I swear, by saint Mark,</span><br />
That the Devil from hell I'll be fetching!"&mdash;<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">O the wife she looked scared,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And wildly Grist stared,</span><br />
And cried, "Nay, my lad, nay,&mdash;thou'rt not able!"&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But the lad plied his chalk,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And muttered strange talk&mdash;</span><br />
Till Grist drew his stool from the table!<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then the lad quenched the rush,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And cried, "Bring a gorse-bush,</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>And under the caldron now kindle!"&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But the Miller cried, "Nay!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Give over, I pray!"&mdash;</span><br />
For his courage began fast to dwindle.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Quoth the lad, "I must on</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Till my conjuring's done;</span><br />
To break off just now would be ruin:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So fetch me the thorns,&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And a devil without horns,</span><br />
In the copper I soon will be brewing!"&mdash;<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">O the Miller he shook</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For fear his strange cook</span><br />
Should, indeed and in truth, prove successful;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But feeling ashamed</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That his pluck should be blamed,</span><br />
Strove to smother his heart-quake distressful.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So the fuel he brought,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And said he feared nought</span><br />
Of the Devil being brewed in his copper:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He'd as quickly believe</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nick would sit in his sieve,</span><br />
Or dance 'mong the wheat in his hopper:&mdash;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And yet, lest strange ill,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From such conjuring skill,</span><br />
Should arise, and their souls be in danger,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He would have his crab-stick,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And would show my lord Nick</span><br />
Some tricks to which he was a stranger!<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">O the lad 'gan to raise</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'Neath the caldron a blaze,&mdash;</span><br />
While the Miller, his crab-cudgel grasping,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Stood on watch, for his life!&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But his terrified wife</span><br />
Her hands&mdash;in devotion&mdash;was clasping!<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When the copper grew warm,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Quoth the lad, "Lest some harm</span><br />
From the visit of Nick be betiding,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Set open the door,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And not long on the floor</span><br />
Will the Goblin of Hell be abiding!"<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Quickly so did the host,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And returned to his post,&mdash;</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>Uplifting his cudgel with trembling:&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His strength was soon proved,&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For the copper-lid moved!&mdash;</span><br />
When Grist's fears grew too big for dissembling.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Turning white as the wall,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His staff he let fall,&mdash;</span><br />
While the Devil from the caldron ascended,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And, all on a heap,&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With a flying leap,</span><br />
On the fear-stricken Miller descended!<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In dread lest his soul,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the Devil's foul goal,</span><br />
Should be burnt to a spiritual cinder,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Grist grabbed the Fiend's throat,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And his grisly eyes smote,&mdash;</span><br />
Till Nick's face seemed a platter of tinder!<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Yea, with many a thwack,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Grist battered Nick's back,&mdash;</span><br />
Nor spared Satan's portly abdomen!&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Hot Nick had lain cold</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">By this time&mdash;but his hold</span><br />
Grist lost, through the screams of his woman!<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">While up from the floor,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And out, at the door,</span><br />
Went the Fiend, with the skip of a dancer!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He seemed panic-struck,&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or, doubted his luck,&mdash;</span><br />
For he neither staid question nor answer!<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Grist!" the beggar-lad cried,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Lay your trembling aside,</span><br />
And tell me, my man, how ye like him.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'Twas well ye were cool:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He'd have proved ye a fool,&mdash;</span><br />
Had ye dar'd with the cudgel to strike him!"<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"By saint Martin!" Grist said,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And, scratching his head,</span><br />
Seemed pondering between good and evil,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"I could swear and avouch</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'Twas the Prior of Roche,&mdash;</span><br />
If thou hadst not said 'twas the Devil!"<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And, in deed and in sooth,&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Though a marvellous truth,&mdash;</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>Yet such was the Fiend's revelation!&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But think it not strange</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He should choose such a change:&mdash;</span><br />
'Tis much after his old occupation:&mdash;<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">An angel of light,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'Tis his darling delight</span><br />
To be reckoned&mdash;'tis very well tested:&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I argue, therefore,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'Twas not sinning much more,</span><br />
In the garb of a Prior to be vested.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Though, with wink, nod, and smile&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">O the world's very vile!&mdash;</span><br />
Grist's neighbours told tales unbelieving,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">How the beggar, so shrewd,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Monk and supper had viewed,</span><br />
And produced 'em!&mdash;the Miller deceiving!<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But I do not belong</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To that heretic throng</span><br />
Who measure their faith with their eyesight:&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thus much I may say&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Grist's cottage of clay</span><br />
Never, now, doth the Prior of Roche visit:&mdash;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But, the sly beggar-lad,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Be he hungry or sad,</span><br />
A remedy finds for each evil<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the Miller's good cheer,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Any day of the year;&mdash;</span><br />
And though Joan looketh shy&mdash;<i>she is civil</i>!<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</span><br />
<br />
The tale was rude, but pleased rude men;<br />
And clamorous many a clown grew, when<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The rebeck ceased to thrill:</span><br />
Ploughboy and neatherd, shepherd swain,<br />
Gosherd and swineherd,&mdash;all were fain<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To prove their tuneful skill.</span><br />
<br />
But, now, Sir Wilfrid waved his hand,<br />
And gently stilled the jarring band:<br />
"What ho!" he cried, "what ails your throats?<br />
Be these your most melodious notes?<br />
Forget ye that to-morrow morn<br />
Old Yule-day and its sports return,&mdash;<br />
And that your freres, from scrogg and carr,<small><a name="f13.1" id="f13.1" href="#f13">[13]</a></small><br />
From heath and wold, and fen, afar,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>Will come to join ye in your glee?<br />
Husband your mirth and minstrelsy,<br />
And let some goodly portion be<br />
Kept for their entertainment meet.<br />
Meanwhile, let frolic guide your feet,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And warm your winter blood!</span><br />
Good night to all!&mdash;For His dear sake<br />
Who bore our sin, if well we wake,<br />
We'll join to banish care and sorrow<br />
With mirth and sport again to-morrow!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And forth the Baron good</span><br />
Passed from his chair, midst looks of love<br />
That showed how truly was enwove<br />
Full, free, and heartfelt gratitude<br />
For kindly deeds, in bosoms rude.<br />
<br />
The broad hall-doors were open cast,<br />
And, smiling, forth De Thorold passed.<br />
Yet, was the crowning hour unflown&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Enjoyment's crowning hour!&mdash;</span><br />
A signal note the pipe hath blown,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And a maiden at the door</span><br />
Craves curtsied leave, with roseate blush,<br />
To bring the sacred missel-bush.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span><br />
Gaily a younker leads the fair,<br />
Proud of his dimpled, blushing care:<br />
All clap their hands, both old and young,<br />
And soon the misseltoe is hung<br />
In the mid-rafters, overhead;<br />
And, while the agile dance they thread,<br />
Such honey do the plough-lads seize<br />
From lips of lasses as the bees<br />
Ne'er sip from sweetest flowers of May.<br />
<br />
All in the rapture of their play,&mdash;<br />
While shrilly swells the mirthsome pipe,<br />
And merrily their light feet trip,&mdash;<br />
Leave we the simple happy throng<br />
Their mirth and rapture to prolong.</div>

<h3>THE</h3>
<h2>BARON'S YULE FEAST.</h2>

<h3>A</h3>
<h2>Christmas Rhyme.</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">Canto</span> III.</h2>

<div class="poem">
Mirth-verse from thee, rude leveller!<br />
Of late, thy dungeon-harpings were<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of discontent and wrong;</span><br />
And we, the Privileged, were banned<br />
For cumber-grounds of fatherland,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In thy drear prison-song.</span><br />
<br />
What fellowship hast thou with times<br />
When love-thralled minstrels chaunted rhymes<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">At feast, in feudal hall,&mdash;</span><br />
And peasant churls, a saucy crew,<br />
Fantastic o'er their wassail grew,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Forgetful of their thrall?&mdash;</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span><br />
Lordlings, your scorn awhile forbear,&mdash;<br />
And with the homely Past compare<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Your tinselled show and state!</span><br />
Mark, if your selfish grandeurs cold<br />
On human hearts so firm a hold<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For ye, and yours, create</span><br />
As they possessed, whose breasts though rude<br />
Glowed with the warmth of brotherhood<br />
For all who toiled, through youth and age,<br />
T' enrich their force-won heritage!<br />
<br />
Mark, if ye feel your swollen pride<br />
Secure, ere ye begin to chide!<br />
Then, lordlings, though ye may discard<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The measures I rehearse,</span><br />
Slight not the lessons of the bard&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The moral of his verse.&mdash;</span><br />
<br />
But <i>we</i> will dare thy verse to chide!<br />
Wouldst re-enact the Barmecide,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And taunt our wretchedness</span><br />
With visioned feast, and song, and dance,&mdash;<br />
While, daily, our grim heritance<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Is famine and distress?</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span><br />
Hast thou forgot thy pledges stern,<br />
Never from Suffering's cause to turn,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But&mdash;to the end of life&mdash;</span><br />
Against Oppression's ruthless band<br />
Still unsubduable to stand,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A champion in the strife?</span><br />
<br />
Think'st thou we suffer less, or feel<br />
To-day's soul-piercing wounds do heal<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The wounds of months and years?</span><br />
Or that our eyes so long have been<br />
Familiar with the hunger keen<br />
Our babes endure, we gaze serene&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Strangers to scalding tears?&mdash;</span><br />
<br />
Ah no! my brothers, not from me<br />
Hath faded solemn memory<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of all your bitter grief:</span><br />
This heart its pledges doth renew&mdash;<br />
To its last pulse it will be true<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To beat for your relief.</span><br />
<br />
My rhymes are trivial, but my aim<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Deem ye not purposeless:</span><br />
I would the homely truth proclaim&mdash;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>That times which knaves full loudly blame<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For feudal haughtiness</span><br />
Would put the grinding crew to shame<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Who prey on your distress.</span><br />
<br />
O that my simple lay might tend<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To kindle some remorse</span><br />
In your oppressors' souls, and bend<br />
Their wills a cheerful help to lend<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And lighten Labour's curse!</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</span><br />
<br />
A night of snow the earth hath clad<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With virgin mantle chill;</span><br />
But in the sky the sun looks glad,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And blythely o'er the hill,</span><br />
From fen and wold, troops many a guest<br />
To sing and smile at Thorold's feast.<br />
<br />
And oft they bless the bounteous sun<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That smileth on the snow;</span><br />
And oft they bless the generous one<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Their homes that bids them fro</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>To glad their hearts with merry cheer,<br />
When Yule returns, in winter drear.<br />
<br />
How joyously the lady bells<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Shout&mdash;though the bluff north-breeze</span><br />
Loudly his boisterous bugle swells!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And though the brooklets freeze,</span><br />
How fair the leafless hawthorn-tree<br />
Waves with its hoar-frost tracery!<br />
While sun-smiles throw o'er stalks and stems<br />
Sparkles so far transcending gems&mdash;<br />
The bard would gloze who said their sheen<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Did not out-diamond</span><br />
All brightest gauds that man hath seen<br />
Worn by earth's proudest king or queen,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In pomp and grandeur throned!</span><br />
<br />
Saint Leonard's monks have chaunted mass,<br />
And clown's and gossip's laughing face<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Is turned unto the porch,&mdash;</span><br />
For now comes mime and motley fool,<br />
Guarding the dizened Lord Misrule<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With mimic pomp and march;</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>And the burly Abbot of Unreason<br />
Forgets not that the blythe Yule season<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Demands his paunch at church;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">And he useth his staff</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">While the rustics laugh,&mdash;</span><br />
And, still, as he layeth his crosier about,<br />
Laugheth aloud each clownish lowt,&mdash;<br />
And the lowt, as he laugheth, from corbels grim,<br />
Sees carven apes ever laughing at him!<br />
<br />
Louder and wilder the merriment grows,<br />
For the hobby-horse comes, and his rider he throws!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">And the dragon's roar,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">As he paweth the floor,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">And belcheth fire</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">In his demon ire,</span><br />
When the Abbot the monster takes by the nose,<br />
Stirreth a tempest of uproar and din&mdash;<br />
Yet none surmiseth the joke is a sin&mdash;<br />
For the saints, from the windows, in purple and gold,<br />
With smiles, say the gossips, Yule games behold;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>And, at Christmas, the Virgin all divine<br />
Smileth on sport, from her silver shrine!<br />
"Come forth, come forth! it is high noon,"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Cries Hugh the seneschal;</span><br />
"My masters, will ye ne'er have done?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Come forth unto the hall!"&mdash;</span><br />
<br />
'Tis high Yule-tide in Torksey hall:<br />
Full many a trophy bedecks the wall<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of prowess in field and wood;</span><br />
Blent with the buckler and grouped with the spear<br />
Hang tusks of the boar, and horns of the deer&mdash;<br />
But De Thorold's guests beheld nought there<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That scented of human blood.</span><br />
The mighty wassail horn suspended<br />
From the tough yew-bow, at Hastings bended,<br />
With wreaths of bright holly and ivy bound,<br />
Were perches for falcons that shrilly screamed,<br />
While their look with the lightning of anger gleamed,<br />
As they chided the fawning of mastiff and hound,<br />
That crouched at the feet of each peasant guest,<br />
And asked, with their eyes, to share the feast.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span><br />
Sir Wilfrid's carven chair of state<br />
'Neath the dais is gently elevate,&mdash;<br />
But his smile bespeaks no lordly pride:<br />
Sweet Edith sits by her loved sire's side,<br />
And five hundred guests, some free, some thrall,<br />
Sit by the tables along the wide hall,<br />
Each with his platter, and stout drink-horn,&mdash;<br />
They count on good cheer this Christmas morn!<br />
<br />
Not long they wait, not long they wish&mdash;<br />
The trumpet peals,&mdash;and the kingly dish,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The head of the brawny boar,</span><br />
Decked with rosemary and laurels gay,&mdash;<br />
Upstarting, they welcome, with loud huzza,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As their fathers did, of yore!</span><br />
And they point to the costard he bears in his mouth,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">And vow the huge pig,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">So luscious a fig,</span><br />
Would not gather to grunch in the daintiful South!<br />
<br />
Strike up, strike up, a louder chime,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ye minstrels in the loft!</span><br />
Strike up! it is no fitting time<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For drowsy strains and soft,&mdash;</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 3em;">When sewers threescore</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Have passed the hall door,</span><br />
And the tables are laden with roast and boiled,<br />
And carvers are hasting, lest all should be spoiled;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">And gossips' tongues clatter</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">More loudly than platter,</span><br />
And tell of their marvel to reckon the sorts:&mdash;<br />
<br />
Ham by fat capon, and beef by green worts;<br />
Ven'son from forest, and mutton from fold;<br />
Brawn from the oak-wood, and hare from the wold;<br />
Wild-goose from fen, and tame from the lea;<br />
And plum&euml;d dish from the heronry&mdash;<br />
With choicest apples 'twas featly rimmed,<br />
And stood next the flagons with malmsey brimmed,&mdash;<br />
Near the knightly swan, begirt with quinces,<br />
Which the gossips said was a dish for princes,&mdash;<br />
Though his place was never to stand before<br />
The garnished head of the royal boar!<br />
<br />
Puddings of plumbs and mince-pies, placed<br />
In plenty along the board, met taste<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>Of gossip and maiden,&mdash;nor did they fail<br />
To sip, now and then, of the double brown ale&mdash;<br />
That ploughman and shepherd vowed and sware<br />
Was each drop so racy, and sparkling, and rare&mdash;<br />
No outlandish Rhenish could with it compare!<br />
<br />
Trow ye they stayed till the meal was done<br />
To pledge a health? Degenerate son<br />
Of friendly sires! a health thrice-told<br />
Each guest had pledged to fellowships old,&mdash;<br />
Untarrying eager mouth to wipe,<br />
And across the board with hearty gripe<br />
Joining rough hands,&mdash;ere the meal was o'er:&mdash;<br />
Hearts and hands went with "healths" in the days of yore!<br />
<br />
The meal is o'er,&mdash;though the time of mirth,<br />
Each brother feels, is but yet in its birth:&mdash;<br />
"Wassail, wassail!" the seneschal cries;<br />
And the spicy bowl rejoiceth all eyes,<br />
When before the baron beloved 'tis set,<br />
And he dippeth horn, and thus doth greet<br />
The honest hearts around him met:&mdash;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span><br />
"Health to ye all, my brothers good!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">All health and happiness!</span><br />
Health to the absent of our blood!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">May Heaven the suffering bless,&mdash;</span><br />
And cheer their hearts who lie at home<br />
In pain, now merry Yule hath come!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My jolly freres, all health!"</span><br />
<br />
The shout is loud and long,&mdash;but tears<br />
Glide quickly from some eyes, while ears<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">List whispering sounds of stealth</span><br />
That tell how the noble Thorold hath sent,<br />
To palsied widow and age-stricken hind,<br />
Clothing and food, and brother-words kind,&mdash;<br />
Cheering their aching languishment!<br />
<br />
"Wassail, wassail!" Sir Wilfrid saith,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Push round the brimming bowl!&mdash;</span><br />
Art thou there, minstrel?&mdash;By my faith,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">All list to hear thee troll,</span><br />
Again, some goodly love-lorn verse!&mdash;<br />
Begin thy ditty to rehearse,<br />
And take, for guerdon, wishes blythe&mdash;<br />
Less thou wilt take red gold therewith!"<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span><br />
Red gold the minstrel saith he scorneth,&mdash;<br />
But, now the merry Yule returneth,<br />
For love of Him whom angels sung,<br />
And love of one his burning tongue<br />
Is fain to name, but may not tell,&mdash;<br />
Once more, unto the harp's sweet swell,<br />
A knightly chanson he will sing,&mdash;<br />
And, straight, he struck the throbbing string.</div>

<h3>Sir Raymond and the False Palmer.</h3>

<h3>THE STRANGER MINSTREL'S SECOND TALE.</h3>

<div class="poem">
Sir Raymond de Clifford, a gallant band<br />
Hath gathered to fight in the Holy Land;<br />
And his lady's heart is sinking in sorrow,&mdash;<br />
For the knight and his lances depart on the morrow!<br />
<br />
"Oh, wherefore, noble Raymond, tell,"&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His lovely ladye weeping said,&mdash;</span><br />
"With lonely sorrow must I dwell,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When but three bridal moons have fled?"</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span><br />
Sir Raymond kissed her pale, pale cheek,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And strove, with a warrior's pride,</span><br />
While an answer of love he essayed to speak,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His flooding tears to hide.</span><br />
<br />
But an image rose in his heated brain,<br />
That shook his heart with vengeful pain,<br />
And anger flashed in his rolling eye,<br />
While his ladye looked on him tremblingly.<br />
<br />
Yet, he answered not in wrathful haste,&mdash;<br />
But clasped his bride to his manly breast;<br />
And with words of tender yet stately dress,<br />
Thus strove to banish her heart's distress:&mdash;<br />
<br />
"De Burgh hath enrolled him with Philip of France,&mdash;<br />
Baron Hubert,&mdash;who challenged De Clifford's lance,<br />
And made him the scoff of the burgher swine,<br />
When he paid his vows at the Virgin's shrine.<br />
<br />
"Oh, ask me not, love, to tarry in shame,&mdash;<br />
Lest 'craven' be added to Raymond's name!<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>To Palestine hastens my mortal foe,&mdash;<br />
And I with our Lion's Heart will go!<br />
<br />
"Nay, Gertrude, repeat not thy sorrowing tale!<br />
Behold in my casque the scallop-shell,&mdash;<br />
And see on my shoulder the Holy Rood&mdash;<br />
The pledge of my emprize&mdash;bedyed in blood!<br />
<br />
"Thou wouldst not, love, I should be forsworn,<br />
Nor the stain on my honour be tamely borne:<br />
Do thou to the saints, each passing day,<br />
For Raymond and royal Richard pray,&mdash;<br />
<br />
"While they rush to the rescue, for God's dear Son;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And soon, for thy Raymond, the conqu'ror's meed,&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">By the skill of this arm, and the strength of my steed,&mdash;</span><br />
From the Paynim swart shall be nobly won.<br />
<br />
"Thou shalt not long for De Clifford mourn,<br />
Ere he to thy bosom of love return;<br />
When blind to the lure of the red-cross bright,<br />
He will bask, for life, in thy beauty's light!"<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span><br />
The morn in the radiant east arose:&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The Red-cross Knight hath spurred his steed</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That courseth as swift as a falcon's speed:&mdash;</span><br />
To the salt-sea shore Sir Raymond goes.<br />
<br />
Soon, the sea he hath crossed, to Palestine;<br />
And there his heart doth chafe and pine,&mdash;<br />
For Hubert de Burgh is not in that land:<br />
He loitereth in France, with Philip's band.<br />
<br />
But De Clifford will never a recreant turn,<br />
While the knightly badge on his arm is borne;<br />
And long, beneath the Syrian sun,<br />
He fasted and fought, and glory won.<br />
<br />
His Gertrude, alas! like a widow pines;<br />
And though on her castle the bright sun shines,<br />
She sees not its beams,&mdash;but in loneliness prays,<br />
Through the live-long hours of her weeping days.&mdash;<br />
<br />
Twelve moons have waned, and the morn is come<br />
When, a year before, from his meed-won home<br />
Sir Raymond went:&mdash;At the castle gate<br />
A reverend Palmer now doth wait.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span><br />
He saith he hath words for the ladye's ear;<br />
And he telleth, in accents dread and drear,<br />
Of De Clifford's death in the Holy Land,<br />
At Richard's side, by a Saracen's hand.<br />
<br />
And he gave to the ladye, when thus he had spoken,&mdash;<br />
Of Sir Raymond's fall a deathly token:<br />
'Twas a lock of his hair all stained with blood,<br />
Entwined on a splinter of Holy Rood.&mdash;<br />
<br />
Then the Palmer in haste from the castle sped;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And from gloomy morn to weary night,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Lorn Gertrude, in her widowed plight,</span><br />
Weepeth and waileth the knightly dead.&mdash;<br />
<br />
Three moons have waned, and the Palmer, again,<br />
By Gertrude stands, and smileth fain;<br />
Nor of haste, nor of death, speaks the Palmer, now;<br />
Nor doth sadness or sorrow bedim his brow.<br />
<br />
He softly sits by the ladye's side,<br />
And vaunteth his deeds of chivalrous pride;<br />
Then lisps, in her secret ear, of things<br />
Which deeply endanger the thrones of kings:<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span><br />
From Philip of France, he saith, he came,<br />
To treat with Prince John, whom she must not name;<br />
And he, in fair France, hath goodly lands,&mdash;<br />
And a thousand vassals there wait his commands.&mdash;<br />
<br />
The ladye liked her gallant guest,&mdash;<br />
For he kenned the themes that pleased her best;<br />
And his tongue, in silken measures skilled,<br />
With goodly ditties her memory filled.<br />
<br />
Thus the Palmer the ladye's ear beguiles,&mdash;<br />
Till Gertrude her sorrow exchangeth for smiles;<br />
And when from the castle the Palmer went,<br />
She watched his return, from the battlement.&mdash;<br />
<br />
Another moon doth swell and wane:&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But how slowly it waneth!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">How her heart now paineth</span><br />
For sight of the Palmer again!<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span><br />
But the Palmer comes, and her heal&euml;d heart<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Derideth pain and sorrow:</span><br />
She pledgeth the Palmer, and smirketh smart,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And saith, "we'll wed to-morrow!"&mdash;</span><br />
<br />
The morrow is come, and at break of day,<br />
'Fore the altar, the abbot, in holy array,<br />
Is joining the Palmer's and Gertrude's hands,&mdash;<br />
But, in sudden amazement the holy man stands!<br />
<br />
For, before the castle, a trumpet's blast<br />
Rings so loud that the Palmer starts aghast;<br />
And, at Gertrude's side, he sinks dismayed,&mdash;<br />
Is't with dread of the living, or fear of the dead?<br />
<br />
The doors of the chapel were open thrown,<br />
And the beams through the pictured windows shone<br />
On the face of De Clifford, with fury flushed,&mdash;<br />
And forth on the Palmer he wildly rushed!&mdash;<br />
<br />
"False Hubert!" he cried; and his knightly sword<br />
Was sheathed in the heart of the fiend-sold lord!&mdash;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>With a scream of terror, Gertrude fell&mdash;<br />
For she knew the pride of Sir Raymond well!<br />
<br />
He flew to raise her&mdash;but 'twas in vain:<br />
Her spirit its flight in fear had ta'en!&mdash;<br />
And Sir Raymond kneels that his soul be shriven,<br />
And the stain of this deed be by grace forgiven:&mdash;<br />
<br />
But ere the Abbot his grace can dole,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">De Clifford's truthful heart is breaking,&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And his soul, also, its flight is taking!&mdash;</span><br />
Christ, speed it to a heavenly goal!&mdash;<br />
Oh, pray for the peace of Sir Raymond's soul!</div>

<h3>THE</h3>
<h2>BARON'S YULE FEAST.</h2>

<h3>A</h3>
<h2>Christmas Rhyme.</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">Canto</span> IV.</h2>

<div class="poem">
What power can stay the burst of song<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When throats with ale are mellow?</span><br />
What wight with nieve so stout and strong<br />
Dares lift it, jolly freres among,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And cry, "Knaves, cease to bellow?"</span><br />
<br />
"'Twas doleful drear,"&mdash;the gossips vowed,&mdash;<br />
To hear the minstrel's piteous tale!<br />
But, when the swineherd tuned his crowd,<small><a name="f14.1" id="f14.1" href="#f14">[14]</a></small><br />
And the gosherd began to grumble loud,<br />
The gossips smiled, and sipped their ale!<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span><br />
"A boon, bold Thorold!" boldly cried<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The gosherd from Croyland fen;</span><br />
"I crave to sing of the fen so wide,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And of geese and goosish men!"</span><br />
<br />
Loud loffe they all; and the baron, with glee,<br />
Cried "begin, good Swithin! for men may see<br />
Thou look'st so like a knowing fowl,<br />
Of geese thou art skilled right well to troll!"<br />
<br />
Stout Swithin sware the baron spake well,&mdash;<br />
And his halting ditty began to tell:<br />
The rhyme was lame, and dull the joke,&mdash;<br />
But it tickled the ears of clownish folk.</div>

<h3>The Gosherd's Song.</h3>

<div class="poem">
'Tis a tale of merry Lincolnshire<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I've heard my grannam tell;</span><br />
And I'll tell it to you, my masters, here,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">An' it likes you all, full well.</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span><br />
A Gosherd on Croyland fen, one day,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Awoke, in haste, from slumber;</span><br />
And on counting his geese, to his sad dismay,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He found there lacked one of the number.</span><br />
<br />
O the Gosherd looked west, and he looked east,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And he looked before and behind him;</span><br />
And his eye from north to south he cast<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For the gander&mdash;but couldn't find him!</span><br />
<br />
So the Gosherd he drave his geese to the cote,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And began, forthwith, to wander</span><br />
Over the marshy wild remote,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In search of the old stray gander.</span><br />
<br />
O the Gosherd he wandered till twilight gray<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Was throwing its mists around him;</span><br />
But the gander seemed farther and farther astray&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For the Gosherd had not yet found him.</span><br />
<br />
So the Gosherd, foredeeming his search in vain,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Resolved no farther to wander;</span><br />
But to Croyland he turned him, in dudgeon, again,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Sore fretting at heart for the gander.</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span><br />
Thus he footed the fens so dreary and dern,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">While his brain, like the sky, was dark'ning;</span><br />
And with dread to the scream o' the startled hern<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the bittern's boom he was heark'ning.</span><br />
<br />
But when the Gosherd the church-yard reached,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Forefearing the dead would be waking,&mdash;</span><br />
Like a craven upon the sward he stretched,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And could travel no farther for quaking!</span><br />
<br />
And there the Gosherd lay through the night,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Not daring to rise and go further:</span><br />
For, in sooth, the Gosherd beheld a sight<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That frighted him more than murther!</span><br />
<br />
From the old church clock the midnight hour<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In hollow tones was pealing,</span><br />
When a slim white ghost to the church porch door<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Seemed up the footpath stealing!</span><br />
<br />
Stark staring upon the sward lay the clown,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And his heart went "pitter patter,"&mdash;</span><br />
Till the ghost in the clay-cold grave sunk down,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When he felt in a twitter-twatter!</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span><br />
Soon&mdash;stretching aloft its long white arms&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From the grave the ghost was peeping!&mdash;</span><br />
Cried the Gosherd, "Our Lady defend me from harms,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And Saint Guthlacke<small><a name="f15.1" id="f15.1" href="#f15">[15]</a></small> have me in his keeping!"</span><br />
<br />
The white ghost hissed!&mdash;the Gosherd swooned!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the morn,&mdash;on the truth 'tis no slander,&mdash;</span><br />
Near the church porch door a new grave he found,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And, therein, the white ghost&mdash;his stray gander!</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</span><br />
<br />
The Gosherd, scarce, his mirthful meed<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Had won, ere Tibbald of Stow,&mdash;</span><br />
With look as pert as the pouncing glede<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When he eyeth the chick below,&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Scraped his crowd,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And clear and loud,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">As the merle-cock shrill,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Or the bell from the hill,</span><br />
Thus tuned his throat to his rough sire's praise&mdash;<br />
His sire the swineherd of olden days:&mdash;</div>

<h3>The Swineherd's Song.</h3>

<div class="poem">
I sing of a swineherd, in Lindsey, so bold,<br />
Who tendeth his flock in the wide forest-fold:<br />
He sheareth no wool from his snouted sheep:<br />
He soweth no corn, and none he doth reap:<br />
Yet the swineherd no lack of good living doth know:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Come jollily trowl</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">The brown round bowl,</span><br />
Like the jovial swineherd of Stow!<br />
<br />
He hedgeth no meadows to fatten his swine:<br />
He renteth no joist for his snorting kine:<br />
They rove through the forest, and browse on the mast,&mdash;<br />
Yet, he lifteth his horn, and bloweth a blast,<br />
And they come at his call, blow he high, blow he low!&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Come, jollily trowl</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">The brown round bowl,</span><br />
And drink to the swineherd of Stow!<br />
<br />
He shunneth the heat 'mong the fern-stalks green,&mdash;<br />
Or dreameth of elves 'neath the forest treen:<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>He wrappeth him up when the oak leaves sere<br />
And the ripe acorns fall, at the wane o' the year;<br />
And he tippleth at Yule, by the log's cheery glow.&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Come, jollily trowl</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">The brown round bowl,</span><br />
And pledge the bold swineherd of Stow!<br />
<br />
The bishop he passeth the swineherd in scorn,&mdash;<br />
Yet, to mass wends the swineherd at Candlemas morn;<br />
And he offereth his horn, at our Lady's hymn,<br />
With bright silver pennies filled up to the brim:&mdash;<br />
Saith the bishop, "A very good fellow, I trow!"&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Come, jollily trowl</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">The brown round bowl,</span><br />
And honour the swineherd of Stow!<br />
<br />
And now the brave swineherd, in stone, ye may spy,<br />
Holding his horn, on the Minster so high!&mdash;<br />
But the swineherd he laugheth, and cracketh his joke,<br />
With his pig-boys that vittle beneath the old oak,&mdash;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>Saying, "Had I no pennies, they'd make me no show!"&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Come, jollily trowl</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">The brown round bowl,</span><br />
And laugh with the swineherd of Stow!<small><a name="f16.1" id="f16.1" href="#f16">[16]</a></small><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</span><br />
<br />
So merrily the chorus rose,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For every guest chimed in,&mdash;</span><br />
That, had the dead been there to doze,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They had surely waked with the din!&mdash;</span><br />
So the rustics said while their brains were mellow;<br />
And all called the swineherd "a jolly good fellow!"<br />
<br />
"Come, hearty Snell!" said the Baron good;<br />
"What sayest thou more of the merry greenwood?"<br />
<br />
"I remember no lay of the forest, now,"&mdash;<br />
Said Snell, with a glance at three maids in a row;<br />
"Belike, I could whimper a love-lorn ditty,&mdash;<br />
If Tib, Doll, and Bell, would listen with pity!"<br />
<br />
"Then chaunt us thy love-song!" cried Baron and guests;<br />
And Snell, looking shrewd, obeyed their behests.</div>

<h3>The Woodman's Love Song.</h3>

<div class="poem">
Along the meads a simple maid<br />
One summer's day a musing strayed,<br />
And, as the cowslips sweet she pressed,<br />
This burthen to the breeze confessed&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">I fear that I'm in love!</span><br />
<br />
For, ever since so playfully<br />
Young Robin trod this path with me,<br />
I always feel more happy here<br />
Than ever I have felt elsewhere:&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">I fear that I'm in love!</span><br />
<br />
And, ever since young Robin talked<br />
So sweetly, while alone we walked,<br />
Of truth, and faith, and constancy,<br />
I've wished he always walked with me:&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">I fear that I'm in love!</span><br />
<br />
And, ever since that pleasing night<br />
When, 'neath the lady moon's fair light,<br />
He asked my hand, but asked in vain,<br />
I've wished he'd walk, and ask again:&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">I fear that I'm in love!</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span><br />
And yet, I greatly fear, alas!<br />
That wish will ne'er be brought to pass!&mdash;<br />
What else to fear I cannot tell:&mdash;<br />
I hope that all will yet be well&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">But, surely, I'm in love!</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</span><br />
<br />
Coy was their look, but true their pleasure,<br />
While the maidens listed the woodman's measure;<br />
Nor shrunk they at laughter of herdsman or hind,<br />
But mixed with the mirth, and still looked kind.<br />
<br />
One maid there was who faintly smiled,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But never joined their laughter:</span><br />
And why, by Yule-mirth unbeguiled,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Sits the Baron's beauteous daughter?</span><br />
Why looks she downcast, yet so sweet,<br />
And seeketh no eyes with mirth to greet?<br />
<br />
"My darling Edith,&mdash;hast no song?"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Saith Thorold, tenderly;</span><br />
"Our guests have tarried to hear thee, long,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And looked with wistful eye!"</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span><br />
Soft words the peerless damosel<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Breathes of imperfect skill:</span><br />
"Sweet birds," smiles the Baron, "all know&mdash;right well,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Can sweetly sing an' they will."</span><br />
<br />
And the stranger minstrel, on his knee,<br />
Offers his harp, with courtesy<br />
So rare and gentle, that the hall<br />
Rings with applause which one and all<br />
Render who share the festival.<br />
<br />
De Thorold smiled; and the maiden took<br />
The harp, with grace in act and look,&mdash;<br />
But waked its echoes tremulously,&mdash;<br />
Singing no noisy jubilee,&mdash;<br />
But a chanson of sweetly stifled pain&mdash;<br />
So sweet&mdash;when ended all were fain<br />
To hear her chaunt it o'er again.</div>

<h3>The Baron's Daughter's Song.</h3>

<div class="poem">
I own the gay lark is the blythest bird<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That welcomes the purple dawn;</span><br />
But a sweeter chorister far is heard<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When the veil of eve is drawn:</span><br />
<br />
When the last lone traveller homeward wends<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">O'er the moorland, drowsily;</span><br />
And the pale bright moon her crescent bends,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And silvers the soft gray sky;</span><br />
<br />
And in silence the wakeful starry crowd<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Their vigil begin to keep;</span><br />
And the hovering mists the flowerets shroud,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And their buds in dew-drops weep;</span><br />
<br />
Oh, then the nightingale's warbling wild,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the depth of the forest dark,</span><br />
Is sweeter, by far, to Sorrow's child,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Than the song of the cheerful lark!</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span><br />
"'Twas sweet, but somewhat sad," said some;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the Baron sought his daughter's eye,&mdash;</span><br />
But, now, there fell a shade of gloom<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On the cheek of Edith;&mdash;and tearfully,</span><br />
He thought she turned to shun his look.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He would have asked his darling's woe,&mdash;</span><br />
But the harp, again, the minstrel took;<br />
And with such prelude as awoke<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Regretful thoughts of an ancient foe</span><br />
In Thorold's soul,&mdash;the minstrel stranger&mdash;<br />
In spite of fear, in spite of danger,&mdash;<br />
In measures sweet and soft, but quaint,&mdash;<br />
Responded thus to Edith's plaint:&mdash;</div>

<h3>The Minstrel's Response.</h3>

<div class="poem">
What meant that glancing of thine eye,<br />
That softly hushed, yet struggling sigh?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Hast thou a thought of woe or weal,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which, breathed, my bosom would not feel?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Why should'st thou, then, that thought conceal,</span><br />
Or hide it from my mind, Love?<br />
<br />
Did'st thou e'er breathe a sigh to me,<br />
And I not breathe as deep to thee?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or hast thou whispered in mine ear</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A word of sorrow or of fear,&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or have I seen thee shed a tear,&mdash;</span><br />
And looked a thought unkind, Love?<br />
<br />
Did e'er a gleam of Love's sweet ray<br />
Across thy beaming countenance play,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or joy its seriousness beguile,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And o'er it cast a radiant smile,&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And mine with kindred joy, the while,</span><br />
Not glow as bright as thine, Love?<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span><br />
Why would'st thou, then, that something seek<br />
To hide within thy breast,&mdash;nor speak,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Its load of doubt, of grief, or fear,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of joy, or sorrow, to mine ear,&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Assured this heart would gladly bear</span><br />
A burthen borne by thine, Love?<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</span><br />
<br />
Sir Wilfrid sat in thoughtful mood,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When the youthful minstrel's song was ended;</span><br />
While Edith by her loved sire stood,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And o'er his chair in sadness bended.</span><br />
The guests were silent;&mdash;for the chaunt,<br />
Where all, of late, were jubilant,<br />
Had kindled quick imagining<br />
Who he might be that thus dared sing&mdash;<br />
Breathing of deep and fervent feeling&mdash;<br />
His tender passion half-revealing.<br />
<br />
Soon, sportive sounds the silence broke:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Saint Leonard's lay-brother,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Who seldom could smother</span><br />
Conception of mischief, or thought of a joke,<br />
Drew forth his old rebeck from under his cloak,&mdash;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 2em;">And touching the chords</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">To brain-sick words,&mdash;</span><br />
While he mimicked a lover's phantasy,<br />
Upward rolling his lustrous eye,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">With warblings wild</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">He flourished and trilled,&mdash;</span><br />
Till mother and maiden aloud 'gan to laugh,<br />
And clown challenged clown more good liquor to quaff.<br />
<br />
These freakish rhymes, in freakish measure,<br />
He chaunted, for his wayward pleasure.</div>

<h3>The Lay-Brother's Love Song.</h3>

<div class="poem">
The lilies are fair, down by the green grove,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where the brooklet glides through the dell;</span><br />
But I view not a lily so fair, while I rove,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As the maid whose name I could tell.</span><br />
<br />
The roses are sweet that blush in the vale,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where the thorn-bush grows by the well;</span><br />
But they breathe not a perfume so sweet on the gale<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As the maid whose name I could tell.</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span><br />
The lark singeth sweetly up in the sky,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Over song-birds bearing the bell;</span><br />
But one bird may for music the skylark defy,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'Tis the maid whose name I could tell.</span><br />
<br />
The angels all brightly glitter and glow,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the regions high where they dwell;</span><br />
But they beam not so bright as one angel below,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'Tis the maid whose name I could tell.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</span><br />
<br />
Sport may, a while, defy heart-cares,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And woo faint smiles from pain;</span><br />
Jesting, a while, may keep down tears&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But they will rise, again!</span><br />
<br />
And saddening thoughts of others' care,<br />
Unwelcome, though they be, to share,&mdash;<br />
And though self-love would coldly say<br />
"Let me laugh on, while others bear<br />
Their own grief-fardels as they may!"&mdash;<br />
Yet, while in sadness droops a brother,<br />
No brother-heart can sadness smother:<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>The tear of fellowship will start&mdash;<br />
The tongue seek comfort to impart.<br />
<br />
And English hearts, of old, were dull<br />
To quell their yearnings pitiful:&mdash;<br />
The guests forgot the jester's strain,<br />
To think upon the harp again,<br />
And of the youth who, to its swell,<br />
So late, his sighs did syllable.<br />
<br />
Natheless, no guest was skilled to find,<br />
At once, fit words that might proclaim,&mdash;<br />
For one who seemed without a name,&mdash;<br />
Their sympathy;&mdash;and so, with kind<br />
Intent, they urged some roundelay<br />
The stranger minstrel would essay.<br />
<br />
He struck the harp, forthwith, but sung<br />
Of passion still,&mdash;and still it clung<br />
To Love&mdash;his full, melodious tongue!</div>

<h3>The Minstrel's Avowal.</h3>

<div class="poem">
O yes! I hold thee in my heart;<br />
Nor shall thy cherished form depart<br />
From its loved home: though sad I be,&mdash;<br />
My heart, my Love, still cleaves to thee!<br />
<br />
My dawn of life is dimmed and dark;<br />
Hope's flame is dwindled to a spark;<br />
But, though I live thus dyingly,&mdash;<br />
My heart, my Love, still cleaves to thee!<br />
<br />
Though short my summer's day hath been,<br />
And now the winter's eve is keen,&mdash;<br />
Yet, while the storm descends on me,&mdash;<br />
My heart, my Love, still cleaves to thee!<br />
<br />
No look of love upon me beams,&mdash;<br />
No tear of pity for me streams:&mdash;<br />
A thing forlorn&mdash;despairingly&mdash;<br />
My heart, my Love, still cleaves to thee!<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span><br />
Thine eye would pity wert thou free<br />
To soothe my woe; and though I be<br />
Condemned to helpless misery,<br />
My heart, my Love, still cleaves to thee!<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</span><br />
<br />
The maidens wept&mdash;the clowns looked glum&mdash;<br />
Each rustic reveller was dumb:<br />
Sir Wilfrid struggled hard to hide<br />
Revengeful throes and ireful pride,<br />
That, now, his wounded bosom swelled,&mdash;<br />
For in that youth he had beheld<br />
An image which had overcast<br />
His life with sorrow in the Past:&mdash;<br />
He struggled,&mdash;and besought the youth<br />
To leave his strains of woe and ruth<br />
For some light lay, or merry rhyme,<br />
More fitting Yule's rejoicing time.&mdash;<br />
And, though it cost him dear, the while,<br />
He eyed the minstrel with a smile.<br />
<br />
The stranger waited not to note<br />
The Baron's speech: like one distraught<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>He struck the harp&mdash;a wild farewell<br />
Thus breathing to its deepest swell:&mdash;</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>The Minstrel's Farewell.</h3>

<div class="poem">
Oh! smile not upon me&mdash;my heart is not smiling:<br />
Too long it hath mourned, 'neath reproach and reviling:<br />
Thy smile is a false one: it never can bless me:<br />
It doth not relieve,&mdash;but more deeply distress me!<br />
<br />
I care not for beauty; I care not for riches:<br />
I am not the slave whom their tinsel bewitches:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A bosom I seek</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">That is true, like mine own,&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Though pale be the cheek,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And its roses all flown,&mdash;</span><br />
And the wearer be desolate, wretched, forlorn,&mdash;<br />
And alike from each soul-soothing solace be torn.<br />
<br />
That heart I would choose, which is stricken and slighted;<br />
Whose joys are all fled, and whose hopes are all blighted;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">For that heart alone</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Would in sympathy thrill</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With one like my own</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">That sorrow doth fill;&mdash;</span><br />
With a heart whose fond breathings have ever been spurned,&mdash;<br />
And hath long their rejection in solitude mourned.<br />
<br />
The harp of my heart is unstrung; and to gladness<br />
Respond not its chords&mdash;but to sorrow and sadness:&mdash;<br />
Then speak not of mirth which my soul hath forsaken!<br />
Why would ye my heart-breaking sorrows awaken?<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</span><br />
<br />
It is the shriek of deathful danger!<br />
None heed the heart-plaint of the stranger!<br />
All start aghast, with deadly fear,<br />
While they, again, that wild shriek hear!<br />
<br />
"He drowns&mdash;Sir Wilfrid!" cries a hind:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"The ferryman is weak:</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>He cannot stem the stream and wind:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Help, help! for Jesu's sake!"</span><br />
<br />
"Help one,&mdash;help all!" the Baron cries;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Whatever boon he craves,</span><br />
I swear, by Christ, that man shall win,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My ferryman who saves!"&mdash;</span><br />
<br />
Out rush the guests: but one was forth<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Who heard no word of boon:</span><br />
His manly heart to deeds of worth<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Needed no clarion.</span><br />
<br />
He dashed into the surging Trent&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nor feared the hurricane;</span><br />
And, ere the breath of life was spent,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He seized the drowning man.&mdash;</span><br />
<br />
"What is thy boon?" said Torksey's lord,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But his cheek was deadly pale;</span><br />
"Tell forth thy heart,&mdash;and to keep his word<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">De Thorold will not fail."&mdash;</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span><br />
"I rushed to save my brother-man,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And not to win thy boon:</span><br />
My just desert had been Heaven's ban&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">If thus I had not done!"&mdash;</span><br />
<br />
Thus spake the minstrel, when the hall<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The Baron's guests had gained:</span><br />
And, now, De Thorold's noble soul<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Spoke out, all unrestrained.</span><br />
<br />
"Then for thy own heart's nobleness<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Tell forth thy boon," he said;</span><br />
"Before thou tell'st thy thought, I guess<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">What wish doth it pervade."&mdash;</span><br />
<br />
"Sweet Edith, his true, plighted love,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Romara asks of thee!</span><br />
What though my kindred with thee strove,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And wrought thee misery?</span><br />
<br />
"Our Lord, for whom we keep this day,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When nailed upon the tree;</span><br />
Did he foredoom his foes, or pray<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That they might pardoned be?"&mdash;</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span><br />
"Son of my ancient foe!" replied<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The Baron to the youth,&mdash;</span><br />
I glad me that my ireful pride<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Already bows to truth:</span><br />
<br />
"Deep zeal to save our brother-man&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Generous self-sacrifice</span><br />
For other's weal&mdash;is nobler than<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">All blood-stained victories!</span><br />
<br />
"Take thy fair boon!&mdash;for thou hast spoiled<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Death,&mdash;greedy Death&mdash;of prey&mdash;</span><br />
This poor man who for me hath toiled<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Full many a stormy day!</span><br />
<br />
"I feel&mdash;to quell the heart's bad flame,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And bless an enemy,</span><br />
Is richer than all earthly fame&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Though the world should be its fee!</span><br />
<br />
"My sire was by thy kinsman slain;&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Yet, as thy tale hath told,</span><br />
Thy kinsman's usurping act was vain&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He died in the dungeon cold.</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span><br />
"Perish the memory of feud,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And deeds of savage strife!</span><br />
Blood still hath led to deeds of blood,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And life hath paid for life!</span><br />
<br />
"My darling Edith shall be thine&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My blood with thine shall blend&mdash;</span><br />
The Saxon with the Norman line&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In love our feuds shall end.</span><br />
<br />
"In age I'll watch ye bless the poor,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And smile upon your love;</span><br />
And, when my pilgrimage is o'er,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I hope to meet above</span><br />
<br />
"Him who on earth a Babe was born<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In lowliness, as on this morn,&mdash;</span><br />
And tabernacled here below,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Lessons of brotherhood to show!"</span><br />
<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span><br />
High was the feast, and rich the song,<br />
For many a day, that did prolong<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The wedding-revelry:</span><br />
<br />
But more it needeth not to sing<br />
Of our fathers' festive revelling:&mdash;<br />

With waking hours of famished throngs,<br />
Brooding on daily deepening wrongs&mdash;<br />

With pictures, that exist in life,<br />

My suffering brothers! still your hope<br />
Hold fast, though hunger make ye droop!<br />
Right&mdash;glorious Right&mdash;shall yet be done!<br />
The Toilers' boon shall yet be won!<br />
Wrong from its fastness shall be hurled&mdash;<br />
The World shall be a happy world!&mdash;<br />
It shall be filled with brother-men,&mdash;<br />

<h4><span class="smcap">Torksey's Hall.</span></h4>

<p>The remains of this ancient erection (of which a representation is given
in the accompanying vignette) form an interesting antiquarian object
beside the Trent, twelve miles from Lincoln, and seven from
Gainsborough. The entire absence of any authentic record, as to the date
of the foundation, or its former possessors, leaves the imagination at
full liberty to clothe it with poetic legend. Visits made to it, in my
childhood, and the hearing of wild narratives respecting the treasures
buried beneath its ruins, and the power of its lords in the times of
chivalry, fixed it, very early, in my mind, as the fit site for a tale
of romance. In addition to the beautiful fragment of a front on the
Trent bank, massive and extensive foundations in the back-ground show
that it must have been an important building in by-gone times.</p>

<p>Torksey was, undoubtedly, one of the first towns in Lincolnshire, in the
Saxon period. Only three of the towns in the county are classed in
Domesday Book, and it is one of them: "Lincoln mans. 982; Stamford 317:
<i>Terchesey</i> 102." (Turner's Hist. of the Anglo-Saxons, 1836, vol. iii.
page 251.) Writers of parts of the county history,&mdash;(for a complete<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
history of Lincolnshire has not yet been written,)&mdash;affirm that Torksey
is the <i>Tiovulfingacester</i> of Venerable Bede; but Smith, the learned
editor of the Cambridge edition of Bede, inclines to the opinion that
Southwell is the town indicated by the pious and industrious monastic.
The passage in Bede leaves every thing to conjecture: he simply relates
that a truth-speaking presbyter and abbot of <i>Pearteneu</i>, (most likely,
Partney, near Horncastle, in Lincolnshire,) named Deda, said that an old
man had told him, that he, with a great multitude, was baptized by
Paulinus, in the presence of King Edwin, "in fluvio Treenta juxta
civitatem qu&aelig; lingua Anglorum Tiovulfingacaestir vocatur"&mdash;in the river
Trent, near the city which in the language of the Angles is called
Tiovulfingacaestir (Smith's Bede: Cambr. 1722, page 97.)&mdash;This passage
occurs immediately after the relation of the Christian mission of
Paulinus into Lindsey, and his conversion of Blecca, governor of
Lincoln, and his family, while the good King Edwin reigned over East
Anglia, to which petty kingdom Lincolnshire seems sometimes to have
belonged, though it was generally comprehended in the kingdom of Mercia,
during the period of the Heptarchy.</p>

<p>If Stukeley be correct in his supposition that the "Foss-dyke," or canal
which connects the Trent here with the Witham at Lincoln, be the work of
the Romans,&mdash;and I know no reason for doubting it,&mdash;Torksey, standing at
the junction of the artificial river with the Trent, must have been an
important station even before the Saxon times. These are Stukeley's
words relative to the commercial use of the Foss-Dyke: "By this means
the corn of Cambridgeshire, Bedfordshire, Huntingdonshire,
Northamptonshire, Rutland, and Lincolnshire, came in;&mdash;from the Trent,
that of Nottinghamshire; all easily<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span> conveyed northward to the utmost
limits of the Roman power there, by the river Ouse, which is navigable
to the imperial city of York. This city (York) was built and placed
there, in that spot, on the very account of the corn-boats coming
thither, and the emperors there resided, on that account; and the great
morass on the river Foss was the haven, or bason, where these corn-boats
unladed. The very name of the Foss at York, and Foss-dyke between
Lincoln and the Trent, are memorials of its being an artificial work,
even as the great Foss road, equally the work of the spade, though in a
different manner." (Stukeley's Pal&aelig;ographia Britannica: Stamford, 1746:
No. 2, page 39.)</p>

<p>In the superb edition of Dugdale's Monasticon Anglicanum, edited by Sir
Henry Ellis and others (1825), occurs the following note, also
evidencing the extent of ancient Torksey:&mdash;"Mr. T. Sympson, who
collected for a history of Lincoln, in a letter preserved in one of
Cole's manuscript volumes in the British Museum, dated January 20, 1741,
says, 'Yesterday, in Atwater's Memorandums, I met with a composition
between the prior of St. Leonard's in Torksey and the nuns of the Fosse,
by which it appears there were then three parishes in Torksey: viz. All
Saints, St. Mary's, and St Peter's." (Vol. iv. page 292.)</p>

<p>At what date this "composition" took place between the prior and nuns,
we are not told: of course, it must have been before the dissolution of
the religious houses. Leland's account of Torksey, which is as follows,
applies to a period immediately succeeding that event.</p>

<p>"The olde buildinges of Torkesey wer on the south of the new toune,
[that is, at the junction of the Trent with the Fosse] but ther now is
litle seene of olde buildinges, more than<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span> a chapelle, wher men say was
the paroch chirch of olde Torkesey; and on Trent side the Yerth so
balkith up that it shewith that there be likelihod hath beene sum
waulle, and by it is a hill of yerth cast up: they caulle it the Wynde
Mille Hille, but I thinke the dungeon of sum olde castelle was there. By
olde Torkesey standith southely the ruines of Fosse Nunnery, hard by the
stone-bridge over Fosse Dik; and there Fosse Dike hath his entering ynto
Trente. There be 2 smaul paroche chirches in new Torkesey and the Priory
of S. Leonard standith on theste [the East] side of it. The ripe [bank]
that Torkesey standith on is sumwhat higher ground than is by the west
ripe of Trent. Trent there devidith, and a good deale upward,
Lincolnshire from Nottinghamshire." (Itinerary: Oxon, 1745: vol. i. page
33.)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Thorold.</span></h4>

<p>The high character for generousness and hospitality assigned to this
most ancient of Lincolnshire families, by history and tradition, was my
only reason for giving its name to an imaginary lord of Torksey.
Ingulphus, the Croyland chronicler, in a passage full of grateful
eloquence,&mdash;(commencing, "Tunc inter familiares nostri monasterii, et
benevolos amicos, erat pr&aelig;cipuus consiliarius quidam. Vicecomes
Lincolni&aelig;, dictus Thoroldus,"&mdash;but too long to quote entire,)&mdash;relates,
that in a dreadful famine, which occurred in the reign of Edward the
Confessor, Thorold, sheriff of Lincolnshire, gave his manor of Bokenhale
to the abbey of Croyland, and afterwards<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span> bestowed upon it his manor of
Spalding, with all its rents and profits. (Gale's Rer. Ang. Script. Vet.
Tom. i. page 65. Oxon, 1684.)</p>

<p>Tanner thus briefly notices the latter circumstance: "Spalding. Thorold
de Bukenale, brother to the charitable countess Godiva, gave a place
here, A.D. 1052, for the habitation, and lands for the maintenance of a
prior and five monks from Croiland." (Notitia, page 251. fol. 1744.) The
generosity of the female Thorold, Godiva, is matter of notoriety in the
traditionary history of Coventry; and her name, and that of her husband,
are found in connection with the history of the very ancient town of
Stow, in Lincolnshire, as benefactors to its church. "Leofricus, comes
Merci&aelig;, et Godiva ejus uxor ecclesiam de S. Marie Stow, quam Eadnotus,
episcopus Lincolni&aelig;, construxit, pluribus ornamentis ditavit"&mdash;Leofric,
earl of Mercia, and Godiva his wife, enriched with many adornments the
church of St. Mary at Stow, which Eadnoth, bishop of Lincoln, built.
(Leland's Collectanea, vol. i. page 158. London, 1770.)</p>

<p>In Kimber and Johnson's Baronetage (vol. i. page 470.) the Thorold of
the reign of Edward the Confessor is said to be descended from Thorold,
sheriff of Lincolnshire in the reign of Kenelph, king of Mercia. Betham,
in his "Baronetage of England" (Ipswich, 1801, vol. i. page 476) says
the pedigree of the Thorolds is a "very fine" one, and enumerates its
several branches of Marston, Blankney, Harmston, Morton, and Claythorp,
and of the "High Hall and Low Hall, in Hough, all within the said county
of Lincoln." Betham, and other writers of his class, enumerate Thorolds,
sheriffs of Lincolnshire, in the reigns of Philip and Mary, Elizabeth,

<p>Sir John Thorold of Syston is now the chief representative of this Saxon

the midst of his tenantry and dependants, to gladden the hearts of the
poor, and receive happiness from diffusing it among others, after the
good example of his ancestors.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Fosse Nunnery.</span></h4>

<p>"The Nunnery of the Fosse was begun by the inhabitants of Torksey upon
some demesne lands belonging to the Crown, pretty early in King John's
time; but King Henry III. confirming it, is said to have been the
founder. The circumstance of the foundation by the men of Torksey is
mentioned in King Henry's charter. The Inspeximus of the 5th Edw. II.,
which contains it, also contains a charter of King John, granting to the
nuns two marks of silver which they had been used to pay annually into
the Exchequer for the land at Torksey. In this charter King John calls
them the Nuns of Torkesey."&mdash;<i>Dugdale's Monasticon</i>, vol. iv. p. 292.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Saint Leonard's.</span></h4>

<p>Bishop Tanner, following Speed and Leland, says, "Torkesey. On the east
side of the new town stood a priory of Black Canons, built by K. John to
the honour of St. Leonard."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>&mdash;<i>Notitia</i>, p. 278. This priory was granted
to Sir Philip Hobby, after the Dissolution: the Fosse Nunnery to Edward

<h4><span class="smcap">Grunsel.</span></h4>

<p>This old word for <i>threshold</i> is still common in Lincolnshire; and with
Milton's meaning so plainly before his understanding (<i>Paradise Lost</i>,
book i. line 460.), it is strange that Dr. Johnson should have given
"the lower part of the building" as an explanation for <i>grunsel</i>. Lemon,
in his "Etymology," spells the word "ground-sill," and then derives the
last syllable from "soil." Nothing can be more stupid. Door-sill is as
common as grunsel, for threshold, in Staffordshire, as well as
Lincolnshire; and, in both counties, "window-sill" is frequent. I
remember, too, in my boyhood, having heard the part of the plough to
which the share is fitted&mdash;the frame of the harrows&mdash;and the frame of a
grindstone, each called "sill" by the farmers of Lindsey.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Romara.</span></h4>

<p>In this instance I have also used a name associated with the ancient
history of Lincolnshire as an imaginary Norman lord of Torksey. "William
de Romara, lord of Bolingbroke, in Lincolnshire, was the first earl of
that county after the Conquest. He was the son of Roger, son of Gerold
de Romara; which Roger married Lucia, daughter of Algar, earl of
Chester, and sister and heir to Morcar, the Saxon earl of Northumberland
and Lincoln. In 1142 he founded the Abbey of Revesby, in com. Linc.,
bearing then the title of Earl of Lincoln."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Bankes</span>' <i>Extinct and

<h3><a name="f9" id="f9" href="#f9.1">IX.</a></h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Heygre.</span></h4>

<p>The tide, at the equinoxes especially, presents a magnificent spectacle
on the Trent. It comes up even to Gainsborough, which is seventy miles
from the sea, in one overwhelming wave, spreading across the wide
river-channel, and frequently putting the sailors into some alarm for
the safety of their vessels, which are dashed to and fro, while "all
hands" are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span> engaged in holding the cables and slackening them, so as to
relieve the ships.</p>

<p>To be in a boat, under the guardianship of a sailor, and to hear the
shouts on every hand of "'Ware Heygre!"&mdash;as the grand wave is beheld
coming on,&mdash;and then to be tossed up and down in the boat, as the wave
is met,&mdash;form no slight excitements for a boy living by the side of
Trent.</p>

<p>I find no key to the derivation of the word Heygre in the Etymologists.
The Keltic verb, &Eacute;igh, signifying, to cry, shout, sound, proclaim; or
the noun Eigin, signifying difficulty, distress, force, violence&mdash;may,
perhaps, be the root from whence came this name for the tide&mdash;so
dissimilar to any other English word of kindred meaning. It is scarcely
probable that the word by which the earliest inhabitants of Britain
would express their surprise at this striking phenomenon should ever be
lost, or changed for another.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Porpoise.</span></h4>

<p>The appearance of a porpoise, at the season when his favourite prey, the
salmon, comes up the river to spawn, is another high excitement to
dwellers on the Trent. I remember well the almost appalling interest
with which, in childhood, I beheld some huge specimen of this marine
visitor, drawn up by crane on a wharf, after an enthusiastic contest for
his capture by the eager sailors.</p>

<h3><a name="f11" id="f11" href="#f11.1">XI.</a></h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">Agnes Plantagenet.</span></h4>

<p>The very interesting relic of the Old Hall at Gainsborough is
associated, in the mind of one who spent more than half his existence in
the old town, with much that is chivalrous. Mowbrays, Percys, De Burghs,
and other high names of the feudal era are in the list of its
possessors, as lords of the manor. None, however, of its former tenants
calls up such stirring associations as 'Old John of Gaunt, time-honoured
Lancaster,' who, with his earldom of Lincoln, held this castle and
enlarged and beautified it. Tradition confidently affirms that his
daughter was starved to death by him, in one of the rooms of the old
tower,&mdash;in consequence of her perverse attachment to her father's
foe,&mdash;the knight of Torksey. Often have I heard the recital, from some
aged gossip, by the fireside on a winter's night; and the rehearsal was
invariably delivered with so much of solemn and serious averment&mdash;that
the lady was still seen,&mdash;that she would point out treasure, to any one
who had the courage to speak to her,&mdash;and that some families <i>had been</i>
enriched by her ghostly means, though they had kept the secret,&mdash;as to
awaken within me no little dread of leaving the fireside for bed in the
dark!</p>

<p>With indescribable feeling I wandered along the carven galleries and
ruined rooms, or crept up the antique massive staircases, of this
crumbling mansion of departed state, in my boyhood,&mdash;deriving from these
stolen visits to its interior, mingled with my admiring gaze at its
battlemented turret, and rich octagonal window, (which tradition said
had lighted the chapel erected by John of Gaunt,) a passion for
chivalry<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span> and romance, that not even my Chartism can quench. Once, and
once only, I remember creeping, under the guidance of an elder boy, up
to the 'dark room' in the turret; but the fear that we should really see
the ghostly Lady caused us to run down the staircase, with beating
hearts, as soon as we had reached the door and had had one momentary
peep!</p>

<p>Other traditions of high interest are connected with this ancient
mansion. One, says that Sweyn the Danish invader, (the remains of whose
camp exist at the distance of a mile from the town,) was killed at a
banquet, by his drunken nobles, in the field adjoining its precincts.
Another, avers that in the Saxon building believed to have stood on the
same spot, as the residence of the earls of Mercia, the glorious
Alfred's wedding-feast was held. Speed gives some little aid to the
imagination in its credent regard for the story: "Elswith, the wife of
king &AElig;lfred, was the daughter of Ethelfred, surnamed Muchel, that is,
the Great, an Earle of the Mercians, who inhabited about Gainesborough,
in Lincolnshire: her mother was Edburg, a lady borne of the Bloud roiall
of Mercia." (Historie of Great Britaine, 1632: page 333.)</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Roche.</span></h4>

<p>A visit to the beautiful ruins of Roche Abbey, near ancient Tickhill,
and to the scenery amidst which they lie, created a youthful desire to
depict them in verse. This doggrel ditty (I forestall the critics!) of
the Miller of Roche is all, however, that I preserved of the imperfect
piece. The ditty is a homely versification of a homely tale which was
often told<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span> by the fireside in Lincolnshire. I never saw anything
resembling it in print, until Mr. Dickens (whose kind attention I cannot
help acknowledging) pointed out to me a similar story in the Decameron.</p>

<p>Roche Abbey, according to the "Monasticon Anglicanum," was founded by
Richard de Builli and Richard Fitz-Turgis, in 1147. "The architecture
bespeaks the time of Edward II. or III." (Edit. 1825: vol. v. p. 502.)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a name="f13" id="f13" href="#f13.1">XIII.</a></h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">Scrogg and Carr.</span></h4>

<p>Johnson says, "Scrog. A stunted shrub, bush, or branch; yet used in some
parts of the north." In Lincolnshire, however, the word is used to
designate wild ground on which "stunted shrub, bush, or branch" grows,
and <i>not</i> as a synonyme with shrub or bush.</p>

<p><i>Carr</i> I have looked for in vain among the etymologists. Johnson merely
quotes Gibson's Camden to show that, in the names of places, <i>Car</i>
"seems to have relation to the British <i>caer</i>, a city;" and Junius,
Skinner, Lemon, Horne Tooke, Jamieson, &amp;c. are silent about it. The word
is applied, in Lincolnshire and Nottinghamshire, to the low lands, or
wide marsh pastures that border the Trent; and I feel little doubt that,
like the word <i>heygre</i>, and many others that might be collected, it has
been in use ever since it was given to these localities, by the primeval
tribes, the Kelts, when they first saw these beautiful tracts, so much
subject to inundation, like the flat borders of their own rivers in the
East. <span class="lang">&#1499;&#1468;&#1463;&#1512;</span> (car) a pasture, is found in Isaiah, xxx. 23. Psalm
lxv.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span> 14, &amp;c., and although <span class="lang">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;</span> (kicar)
is simply translated "plain" in the established version, and Gesenius would, still more
vaguely, render it "circuit, surrounding country," (from <span class="lang">&#1499;&#1493;&#1512;</span>, in
Arabic, <i>to be round</i>,) yet I suspect the words come from the same root,
and have the same meaning. Thus, Genesis xiii. 10.</p>
<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/hebrew.png" alt="Hebrew" /></div>
<p>might literally be rendered "And Lot raised his eyes, and saw all the carr of
the Jordan, that it was well watered everywhere, before Jehovah
destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, like the garden of Jehovah; like the land
of Mitzraim, as thou approachest Zoar." How natural, that the Keltic or
Kymric tribes should behold, in the Trent pastures, the resemblance of
the plains on the banks of the Jordan, the Nile, the Tigris, and
Euphrates&mdash;(for the term <span class="lang">&#1504;&#1463;&#1503;-&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1465;&#1493;&#1464;&#1492;</span> <i>garden of Jehovah</i> most probably
denotes Mesopotamia, in the very ancient fragments collected by Moses to
form the book of Genesis)&mdash;and should denote them by the same name!</p>

<p><span class="lang">&#1590; &#1575;&#1585;</span>, khaw&#257;r, also signifies "low or sloping ground," in
Richardson's Arabic and Persian Dictionary; and "Carr, a bog, a fen, or
morass," occurs in Armstrong's Gaelic Dictionary. The word I conceive is
thus clearly traced to its Keltic or Eastern origin.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Crowd.</span></h4>

<p>Sir John Hawkins, in his highly curious "History of Music" (vol. ii.
page 274) says "The <i>Cruth</i> or <i>Crowth</i>" was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span> an instrument "formerly in
common use in the principality of Wales," and is the "prototype of the
whole fidicinal species of musical instruments." "It has six strings,
supported by a bridge, and is played on by a bow." "The word <i>Cruth</i> is
pronounced in English <i>Crowth</i>, and corruptly <i>Crowd</i>." "L&THORN;u&eth;
is the Saxon appellation given by Leland, for the instrument
(Collectanea: vol. v.)" "A player on the <i>cruth</i> was called a Crowther
or Crowder, and so also is a common fiddler to this day; and hence,
undoubtedly, Crowther, or Crowder, a common surname. Butler, with his
usual humour, has characterised a common fiddler, and given him the name
of Crowdero."</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Rebeck.</span></h4>

<p>Rebeck is a word well known from Milton's exquisite "L'Allegro." Sir
John Hawkins (vol. ii. page 86) traces it to the Moorish <i>Rebeb</i>; and
believes he finds this old three-stringed fiddle in the hands of
Chaucer's Absolon, the parish-clerk, who could "plaie songs on a smale
ribible."</p>
